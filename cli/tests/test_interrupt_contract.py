"""Ctrl-C at a prompt exits 130 without a message, as the exit table promises (w3/388).

`USAGE.md` carves out exactly two signals that mean the run was ended on
purpose: Ctrl-C exits 130 and a closed downstream pipe exits 141, both without
a message. The pipe half was fixed in w3/378. This is the SIGINT half.

A mid-computation Ctrl-C already complied. `bea query`'s interactive shell is
not a run to end: there Ctrl-C cancels the line, as under `bean-query` (w1/066).
A `bea`-owned Typer prompt did not: `click` turns the `KeyboardInterrupt` into
`Abort`, and its own top-level handler prints `Aborted!` and exits 1 — so a
script could not tell a deliberate Ctrl-C from a genuine failure, which is the
whole reason the carve-out exists.

These tests need a real terminal: the prompts never appear otherwise, so the
defect cannot be reproduced with redirected stdin. Each spawns `bea` under
`pty.fork()` and writes a literal ETX once the prompt is on screen.
