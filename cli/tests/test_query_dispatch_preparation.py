"""The same BQL text means the same thing however it is submitted (w3/398).

`_executed` applies bea's pre-execution handling — quoting the reserved table
names that BQL also uses as keywords (w3/246, w3/247) and refusing a zero-day
`OPEN ON … CLOSE ON …` window (w3/372) — but it wraps the *outer* request. For
`.run accounts` that request is the dot command, not the stored SQL, and
interactively typed SQL reached upstream's `execute` directly.

So the same text answered differently depending on how it arrived:
`FROM accounts` counted three accounts directly and four postings through
`.run`, `FROM balances` was a syntax error unquoted, and a zero-day window
returned `(no rows)` instead of saying it spans no days.

The preparation now lives in `PreciseShell.execute`, which is the one place
every BQL path arrives at — dot commands go to `do_*` instead.
