"""`.output` refuses every loaded file, not just the ones holding entries (w3/400).

`_loaded_files` built its protection set from `entries[].meta.filename`, so an
included child containing only `option` lines, comments or further includes
produced no entries and was absent from it. Interactive `.output` then opened
that file with `"w"` and a query result replaced a settings file — after which
the ledger no longer loaded at all.

The loader already records its whole include closure in `options["include"]`;
that is what the guard reads now.

The one-shot `--output` guard walks includes independently in the frontend and
was always correct, which is why it refused the same destination. It is kept
here as the control.
