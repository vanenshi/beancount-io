"""`doctor roundtrip` never destroys a file that was already there (w3/409).

Upstream's `roundtrip` writes its comparison to `<stem>.roundtrip1<suffix>` and
`<stem>.roundtrip2<suffix>` beside the ledger, opening both with `w`, and
removes them in a `finally` — unconditionally. Anything already at those paths
is therefore overwritten and then deleted. A read-only diagnostic reported
`Entries are the same. Congratulations.` at exit 0 while destroying a ledger
include sitting beside the file it was checking; the next `bea check` failed
on the account the deleted file declared.

`bea` cannot make upstream choose other names, so it refuses before either
forwarding branch runs, naming the paths. That is what this file pins, along
with the ordinary runs the guard must not disturb.
