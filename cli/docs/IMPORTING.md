# Importing bank exports

A bank CSV needs no Python importer. When its header row names columns bea
recognizes, `bea import statement.csv --account Assets:Checking` is the whole
command; otherwise name the columns with `--csv`. Either way bea previews the
resulting Beancount directives, checks duplicates, validates the candidate
ledger, and applies only when requested.

```bash
bea --no-input init books --currency USD --date 2026-08-01
cat > statement.csv <<'EOF'
Date,Payee,Narration,Amount
2026-08-02,Whole Foods,groceries,-20.00
2026-08-03,Shell,gas,-40.00
2026-08-04,Unknown Shop,mystery,-9.99
EOF
bea --file books/main.bean add open --date 2026-08-01 --account Expenses:Transport:Fuel -c USD
cat > rules.toml <<'EOF'
[[rule]]
match = "whole foods|trader joe|corner market"
account = "Expenses:Groceries"

[[rule]]
match = "shell|chevron|exxon"
account = "Expenses:Transport:Fuel"
EOF
bea --file books/main.bean import statement.csv --csv date=Date,amount=Amount,payee=Payee,narration=Narration --account Assets:Checking --rules rules.toml
bea --file books/main.bean import statement.csv --apply
```

The first import previews every row; the mapping is remembered, so `--apply`
re-runs flag-free. The `rules.toml` above matches the bundled
[rules example](examples/rules.toml). The walkthrough as written exits **0**
throughout and leaves one `!`-flagged row for the categorization queue below.
A Python importer remains the advanced path for formats the column mapping
cannot express; it is documented second, under
[A Python importer (`--config`)](#a-python-importer---config).

The preview includes every directive, destination accounts, row status, date,
payee, signed source amount, a unified ledger diff, and validation errors.
Duplicate candidates show the existing entry and its source location beside
the explanation. Fix categories or account openings
in the mapping, rules, or ledger, then rerun the preview. `--apply`
recomputes the preview from the current files and refuses an invalid result.
A ledger that already fails validation blocks the import; `--allow-errors`
previews and applies over semantic errors such as a failing balance assertion,
never over syntax errors, and lists what it tolerated under
`validation_warnings` in JSON.
A concurrent ledger change during preparation causes exit **4**; no entries
are appended. An `--apply` refused because duplicates need review also exits
**4**, including under `--no-input`. A successful preview or an explicit
decision to skip all duplicates exits **0**.
There is no automatic categorization model or hosted request in this command.

For split ledgers, add `--into 2026.bean` to write an included file while
`--file books/main.bean` continues to identify the validation root. The
destination is relative to the root ledger's directory and must already be
included by a literal path or glob. The preview's `into` and diff identify the
actual destination. If it does not exist, a successful `--apply` creates it;
previews, rejected imports, and imports with nothing new leave it absent.

## CSV without an importer (`--csv`)

The mapping implements the same identify/account/extract shape as a Python
importer, so preview, duplicate matching, validation, diff, and apply are
unchanged. The walkthrough above is the whole interface; this section is the
reference:

`--csv` takes `field=Column` pairs. `date` is required, as is at least one of
`payee` and `narration` — a single bank description column belongs in
`narration`, which keeps the payee field free for the merchant that
payee-based reporting groups by. `id` and `currency` are optional. Amounts
take either `amount=Column` or the `debit=A,credit=B` pair (exactly one of the
two). With the pair, the *column* decides the direction and the cell supplies
only the magnitude: a debit posts negative and a credit positive however the
bank signed the cell, so a `Money Out` column printed `-4.50` still posts
`-4.50`. A column that mixes non-zero signs is refused naming the column and
the two disagreeing rows — map it as `amount=` instead, where the sign *is* the
direction. Exactly one cell per row must be filled, and a cell that parses to
zero counts as empty, so the `Debit=30.00,Credit=0.00` shape banks zero-fill
imports as `-30.00`. Amount, debit, and credit cells must use decimal notation (`1000`,
not `1e3`); a notation error names the row and column before anything is written.
Cells may carry currency symbols (`$4.50`, `4,50 €`), thousands separators,
accounting parentheses or a trailing minus for negatives (one marker per cell:
`(-5.00)` is refused rather than read as `+5.00`), and comma decimals —
the point-vs-comma convention is resolved from the whole column, and a column
mixing `1,000.00` with `1.000,00` is refused rather than guessed. A lone
`1,234` stays a thousands group, but `0,125` and `1613,030` cannot be one,
so they import as `0.125` and `1613.030`. `NaN` and
`Infinity` are blocked at preview time with the row named, so `--apply` can
never write them. A failed parse names the cell, the row, and the accepted
spellings.
Amounts default to bank sign (outflows negative); add `sign=ledger`
when the export uses the opposite convention. A row's commodity is resolved in
this order: the `currency=` column, then the source account's own currency when
its `open` directive names exactly one, then the ledger's single
`operating_currency`; with none of the three, the row is refused. `currency=`
also takes a commodity name the file has no column for — `--csv
…,currency=EUR` — for an export that never states its own currency. Such a
constant must be a commodity the ledger already knows (declared with
`commodity`, named by an `open`, posted, priced, or the operating currency),
and the preview notes that every row posts in it; a value that differs from a
header only by case (`currency=CURRENCY` for a `Currency` column) is refused
with the header it probably meant, as is any other mistyped column. A
currency cell must be exactly one commodity name (`USD`, `VFIAX`, `NT.TO`);
anything else — a space, a comma, a line break — is refused naming the row and
column before the preview, and nothing is written. A cell
carrying a symbol that names exactly one commodity (`€`, `£`, `₹`, …) and
contradicts the resolved currency is refused naming the row and the symbol,
rather than relabelled; `$` and `¥` name several commodities each and are
accepted as before. `--account` names the source account and
is required. The file may start with a BOM and with blank lines before the
header (error line numbers still count them); header cells are stripped before
matching. Field separators are detected from the header among comma,
semicolon, tab, and pipe — the one on which the header and the first rows
split into the same number of fields, so quoted `;` or dates like
`Jan 05, 2026` cannot outvote the real separator; pass `--delimiter ','`, `--delimiter ';'`, or
`--delimiter tab` to force one — or `delimiter=';'` inside `--csv` itself.
Files read as UTF-8 (with or without a BOM) unless `--csv encoding=` names
cp1252 or latin-1 — Windows exports with accented payees need
`encoding=cp1252`. A bare `--csv encoding=cp1252` decodes with that codec
and then infers the mapping like `auto`. Without the key, a non-UTF-8 file
fails before anything is read: the error names the byte offset and, when the
file decodes as cp1252, says so with the override to pass. A file no
candidate decodes lists the encodings tried instead. UTF-16 text (Excel's
"Unicode Text", recognized by its byte-order mark or NUL bytes) is refused
under any `encoding=` with a request to re-save it as UTF-8, and a `--rules`
file may start with a UTF-8 BOM. Unknown fields, missing columns, bad dates, and bad amounts fail
with the row number and column name, as `Row 2 (line 5)`: the row is the one
the preview's `ROW` column shows, and the physical file line follows it for
hand-editing. Rows whose mapped cells are all empty or
whitespace are skipped instead, and the preview counts them — which is why the
two numbers differ. A mapped column that appears more than
once in the header, or a quote left open at the end of the file, fails before
anything is written. So does a row carrying more fields than the header
declares — usually an unquoted separator inside a value, as in
`2026-01-02,-1,234.56,Coffee` under a three-column header. That row is
ambiguous rather than merely wrong (bad quoting, or the wrong delimiter), so
it is refused naming the file, line and field counts instead of being
truncated to fit, which silently shifted the remaining cells. Surplus cells
that are *empty* are tolerated: a trailing separator loses no data. Misuse exits **2**.

Rows that would post to an account the ledger never opened — or a currency
the open directive disallows — are shown `blocked`, not ready: the row names
the missing account and the `bea add open` line that fixes it, stays in the
diff so the proposal stays visible, and `--apply` refuses with exit **4**
while any row is blocked. A currency mismatch offers the currency setting
first and widening the `open` directive last: widening it would book the
foreign amounts as the wrong commodity. An account under a root the ledger
does not use (`Foo:Bar`; the roots are its `name_*` options) can never be
opened: `--account`, `--default-account`, and rule accounts naming one exit
**2**, a category cell naming one queues the row for review, and an importer
posting to one is blocked without an `add open` suggestion.

### Reading the header row

With no `--csv`, no remembered mapping, and no Python importer configured, bea
reads the mapping off the header row. `--csv auto` asks for the same reading
outright and fails naming the file's actual columns when it cannot. A role is
only filled when exactly one column claims it, so an export carrying both
`Description` and `Memo` reports the ambiguity — naming the role, the tied
columns, and a `--csv` line that resolves it — and leaves that
role unmapped rather than guessing. `Description`-style headers map to
`narration`; `Payee` and `Merchant` map to `payee`.

`--date-format` is likewise read from the file when unset: bea keeps the one
`strptime` format that parses every date in the column. A column whose days
never pass the twelfth cannot distinguish `%m/%d/%Y` from `%d/%m/%Y`, and bea
says so instead of choosing quietly. When no known format reads the whole
column, the error names the row whose date ruled out the last one; correct
that cell or pass `--date-format`. Anything read this way is printed as the
equivalent flags, so a wrong reading is visible in the preview that writes
nothing. An option you type always wins over one bea read or remembered.

An `id` column becomes `bank_id` metadata, so stable bank IDs deduplicate like
a Python importer's. Rows without one get the same `csv:sha256:` content hash
described under [Duplicate decisions](#duplicate-decisions).

### Categorization rules (`--rules`)

A TOML rules file categorizes rows by regex over three fields — payee,
narration, then the category label (case-insensitive, with pattern and text
compared NFC-normalized, so a composed `café` matches a decomposed one); the
first matching rule wins:

```toml
[[rule]]
match = "whole foods|trader joe"
account = "Expenses:Groceries"
```

See the bundled [rules example](examples/rules.toml). Each entry needs
`match` and `account`; a bad regex or a file without a `[[rule]]` list fails
naming the rule number. An empty or whitespace-only `match` is refused, and
so is any pattern that matches empty text (a trailing `|` as in
`"whole foods|"`, `(cafe)?`), since it would match every row — write
`match = ".*"` for an explicit catch-all. Rules beat a `category`
column, and also match its labels: a rule pattern matching a bank's own
label categorizes the row before the category column is considered. An
explicit `category=Column` mapping, or a `Category` header when unmapped,
categorizes rows the rules skip, but only when the value is a full account
name such as `Expenses:Groceries`. A bank's own label such as `Groceries`
is not an account; rows no rule matches join the review queue and the
preview says so once, naming the labels it saw. Rows nothing matches post to
`--default-account` (`Expenses:Uncategorized`) with flag `!`, while matched
rows carry `*`. The preview's `RULE` column names the winning pattern (or
the category value, or `unmatched`), and JSON rows carry the same value in
`rule`. List the categorization queue with
`bea list transaction --flag '!'`, categorize, and re-import only after
opening any missing accounts: a rule naming an account the ledger does not
open fails validation with the `bea add open` command to run.

```bash
cat > category.csv <<'EOF'
Date,Description,Amount,Category
2026-08-05,Card purchase,-12.50,STARBUCKS
EOF
cat > category-rules.toml <<'EOF'
[[rule]]
match = "starbucks"
account = "Expenses:Dining"
EOF
bea --file books/main.bean import category.csv --csv date=Date,amount=Amount,narration=Description,category=Category --account Assets:Checking --rules category-rules.toml
```

The mapping is remembered per root ledger, CSV header row, and source account,
along with the `--rules` path, `--default-account`, an explicit
`--date-format`, and the delimiter — but never `sign=`, which a different file
always needs passed explicitly. The one exception keeps a preview honest: after
`sign=ledger`, a flag-free `--apply` of the byte-identical file re-applies it
and says so; another file sharing the header is read bank-signed, with a note
naming the file that used `sign=ledger`. When only one account uses those headers, the next import needs
no flags. If checking and savings exports share headers, their mappings are
kept separately and subsequent previews and applies require
`--account ACCOUNT`; bea refuses to choose between them. Always specify
`--account` when importing from a new account, since headers alone cannot
identify a bank account. For example:
`bea import checking.csv --account Assets:Checking --apply`.
For a remembered mapping, human output reports
`Using remembered settings for <file>` (or `Using settings remembered from
<seeding file> for <file>`) listing every setting in force, and JSON reports
`config_source` `remembered --csv` plus a `remembered` object with the same
fields (`null` when the run used no memory). A successful explicit `--csv`
preview or apply replaces the remembered settings; settings it drops are named,
never silently discarded. Failed runs leave the saved settings unchanged,
including an apply rejected for review with exit 4. A successful preview can
remember its mapping even when some rows need review. Only a `--date-format`
you passed is remembered, and even that is re-validated per file: when the new
export unambiguously uses another convention, the import refuses and names the
expected format, since two
exports can share a header row without sharing a date convention. A
remembered `--rules` path that is missing or unreadable degrades to a warning
and an unruled import rather than failing; that repair is saved only after a
successful preview or apply. A changed header row matches
nothing remembered, and bea falls back to reading that header directly.

## A Python importer (`--config`)

For formats the column mapping cannot express, `bea import` calls configured
importers using the modern
[Beangulp interface](https://github.com/beancount/beangulp/blob/master/beangulp/importer.py):
`identify(filepath)`, `account(filepath)`, and `extract(filepath, existing)`.
The importer owns bank-specific parsing and categorization. The importer must
supply explicit amounts on source-account postings so duplicate matching uses
actual bank amounts.

```bash norun
# Needs a Python importer file; the runnable example below provides one.
bea --file books/main.bean import statement.csv --config importers.py
bea --file books/main.bean import statement.csv --apply
```

The Python configuration must export `CONFIG = [importer, ...]`. An import
executes this Python file, so use your own local configuration. The selected
path is remembered per root ledger. An explicit `--config` overrides it;
without a saved path, the CLI uses `importers.py` beside the root ledger.
It does not search the working directory or parent directories for Python files.
Human output reports `Using importers from <path> (<source>)` on stderr. The
source is `--config`, `remembered`, or `default beside root ledger`. JSON
includes the path in `config` and its source in `config_source`.
If multiple importers recognize the export, select one with `--importer NAME`.
An unknown name lists the available importer names; a recognized name whose
importer rejects the file reports that separately.
The configuration can import sibling modules. Importer output — including what a child
process it runs prints — is captured in the preview's `importer_output` field
so it does not corrupt JSON.
For importer exceptions, put `--debug` before the command to see the traceback:

```bash norun
# Needs a Python importer file; shows where a traceback would appear.
bea --debug --file books/main.bean import statement.csv --config importers.py
```

With `--json --debug`, the traceback is a string in `error.traceback`; stderr
remains one JSON object and stdout stays empty on failure.

## A runnable example

The bundled [CSV example](examples/csv_importers.py) uses only the standard
library and Beancount, so it runs in the Homebrew installation without extras.
Its input is a categorized export with a signed checking-account amount.
From a CLI source checkout, run:

```bash
bea --no-input init books-py --currency USD --date 2026-08-01
cat > bank.csv <<'EOF'
Date,Payee,Narration,Amount,Currency,Category,BankID
2026-08-02,Cafe,Coffee,-5.25,USD,Expenses:Dining,bank-001
2026-08-03,Employer,Salary,1000,USD,Income:Salary,bank-002
EOF
bea --file books-py/main.bean import bank.csv --config docs/examples/csv_importers.py
bea --file books-py/main.bean import bank.csv --config docs/examples/csv_importers.py --apply
bea --file books-py/main.bean check
```

For a bank's native CSV, try [`--csv`](#csv-without-an-importer---csv)
first; for OFX or QIF, or a CSV the mapping cannot express, use an importer
for that exact format.
The sample is a configuration example, not a universal bank parser. Legacy
Beancount v2 importers that take a `FileMemo` need Beangulp's `Adapter` in the
configuration; the CLI calls the current interface directly.

## Duplicate decisions

`bea import` follows the [`import-id` convention](../../skills/.claude/skills/beancount-import/references/dedup.md),
so entries written by the CLI and by the `beancount-import` / `beancount-migrate`
skills deduplicate against each other: the ledger itself is the dedup database.

- A stable transaction ID is strong evidence. By default the CLI checks
  transaction metadata `bank_id`, `fitid`, `transaction_id`, and `imported_id`,
  scoped to the importer's source account, and always checks `import-id` and
  `import-id-2`. Use repeated `--id-key KEY` options to replace the native-ID
  list for your importer (a custom key uses its own name as the namespace).
  `--id-key id` is accepted as an alias for `bank_id`, the canonical key the
  `--csv` path writes, so it never silently disables bank-ID dedupe.
  IDs must be stable and unique within that account. An exact match is skipped;
  reused native IDs with different source amounts or commodities are conflicts
  requiring review. An ID repeated within one export with different data is a
  conflict too; it names the earlier row of the import, and the fix is in the
  source file rather than the ledger. Payee, narration, date, flag, and counter-account edits do
  not change that identity (generated ids: see below). The preview's `ID` column names each row's
  identifier source: `bank` for a bank column, `hash` for a content hash, or
  `importer` for an `import-id` the importer supplied.
- A row with a native ID is written with `import-id: "<kind>:<id>"` (`bank_id`
  becomes `bank:`, `fitid` becomes `ofx:`). A row without one is written with
  `import-id: "csv:sha256:<16 hex>"` hashed from
  `date|amount|description|account` per the convention: the ISO date, the
  exact source amount with its commodity and trailing zeros stripped
  (`-54.2 USD`), the narration (or payee when
  narration is empty) uppercased with whitespace collapsed, and the source
  account. A row with both a payee and a narration hashes both, as
  `date|amount|payee|narration|account`, so rows that differ only in payee
  keep distinct ids however the export orders them. Identical rows within one
  file take an occurrence suffix, so re-importing the same file skips every row. Keep this metadata when editing
  entries. New writes no longer carry the pre-release `bea_import_id` key, but
  existing entries with it still match on re-import.
- A generated id matches by its digest under any documented prefix, so a bank
  export overlapping history that `beancount-migrate` wrote as
  `monarch:sha256:…` (or `mint:`/`qbo:`) is skipped rather than written
  again. For each side of a merged transfer, the digest is found through
  `import-id` or `import-id-2`. The digest already binds the date, amount,
  description, and account of the original source row, so a canonical
  generated-id hit is a duplicate even if the ledger's date, amounts, payee, or
  narration were edited later. Preserve the ID while reviewing an entry; it
  records where that entry came from, not its current presentation. A canonical
  hit also takes precedence over older file IDs retained on the same entry.
- Ids written before the amount was exact (it was rounded to two decimals with
  no commodity, or later to 28 significant digits) or before the description
  was NFC-normalized are still
  recognized: import offers every older spelling as a lookup-only key, matches
  it, and writes only the current one, so no re-hash pass is needed. An older
  *amount* digest also has to agree with the date and source amounts before it counts
  as a match, because that form was lossy enough to give two different rows one
  digest — a disagreement is ignored rather than reported as a conflict. A
  reused **native** bank ID with different source amounts or commodities is
  still a conflict.
- Ids written before payees were hashed (narration only) also stay
  lookup-only. Because their occurrence suffixes followed the old export's row
  order, every such id that a group of same-narration rows reaches is given to
  the row with that entry's payee; an id whose payee no row has (edited since)
  stays with the row at its old position.
- Date, normalized payee, and signed source amount/currency identify a *possible*
  duplicate even when bank IDs or narration differ. A row with no payee (the
  one-description mapping) is compared by its normalized narration instead, so
  two different same-day purchases of one amount are both new. This does not prove
  duplication: two real purchases can have identical details. `--apply` requires
  `--duplicates skip` or `--duplicates include`; choose include to preserve
  legitimate repeated purchases. Review the rows before choosing;
  the choice applies to all possible matches in that invocation.
- Identical nontransaction directives are skipped. Import does not change the
  meaning of existing transactions or delete them, and never modifies existing
  lines: appended entries are written where `bea format` would put them, and
  `bea format` remains the only command that realigns a file.
  Amount corrections and recategorization of existing entries remain deliberate
  ledger edits.

Both existing entries and accepted rows in the same batch participate in
matching. `bea add transactions --from FILE.json` remains a plain validated
append operation and intentionally does not deduplicate.

## Python dependencies and metadata

No extra dependency is needed for the CSV mapper or the importer interface
itself. Configurations that `import beangulp` (or other importer packages) need
those packages in the **managed engine**, not the bea frontend:

```bash norun
# Needs network to provision Beangulp into the managed engine, system libmagic,
# a Python importer, and a real OFX/QIF (or similar) bank export.
bea engine enable beangulp
# Beangulp needs the system libmagic library (python-magic).
bea --file books/main.bean import bank.ofx --config importers.py
# Standalone Beangulp lifecycle (not bea import --apply):
bea ingest identify --config ingest.py downloads/
bea ingest extract --config ingest.py downloads/ -o extracted.bean
bea ingest archive --config ingest.py downloads/ -o documents/ --dry-run
```

`bea engine status` shows whether each optional feature is enabled. This does
not alter the Homebrew/PyPI frontend environment. Add third-party importer
packages the same way you would for any engine-side dependency once Beangulp is
enabled, or keep a separate project environment for custom importer development.
For raw identify/extract/archive that preserve Beangulp hooks, dry-runs, and
archive naming, use `bea ingest` with an ingest script that calls
`beangulp.Ingest(...)()`. Preview/apply into the ledger remains `bea import`.

Native transaction and posting metadata are retained, including booleans,
decimal numbers, dates, and amounts. Custom directive boolean/date values also
survive listing and serialization. See [the JSON reference](USAGE.md#investment-postings-and-metadata)
for the typed metadata representation used by `bea list transaction` and
`bea add transactions`.

Imported payees, narrations, and string metadata replace CR/LF line breaks with
spaces before preview, duplicate matching, and writing. A quoted multiline CSV
field therefore stays on one ledger line, keeping merchant-provided text
readable in diffs and tables. Quotes and backslashes retain their contents;
typed metadata retains its type.

In global `--json` mode, preview and successful application return the normal
envelope. An application blocked by conflicts or validation exits **4** or
**1** and includes the full preview in `error.result`, with `written: 0`.
Review refusals also list the affected preview row numbers and reasons in
the error details, including in human `--apply` output.
