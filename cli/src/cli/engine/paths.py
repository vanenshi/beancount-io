"""Where the managed engine environment lives, and how to find things inside it.

Layout questions only: no subprocesses, no installing, and nothing that imports
Beancount. `provision` creates what these paths name and `launch` runs it.

Three overrides, each resolved on every call rather than at import, because the
environment is what tests and CI jobs set:

- `$BEA_ENGINE_PYTHON` names an interpreter directly and skips provisioning
  entirely. This is how the test suite points at an environment it prepared.
- `$BEA_ENGINE_DIR` relocates the managed environment.
- `$XDG_DATA_HOME` moves the default root, the same way the rest of `bea`
  honors the XDG variables (see `cli.config`).
