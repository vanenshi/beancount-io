    closed pipe exits 141, both without a message — and a script needs that to

    `bea query`'s interactive shell already complied; a Typer prompt did not,
    because `click` turns the `KeyboardInterrupt` into `Abort` and its own
    top-level handler prints `Aborted!` and exits 1.

    Silent means silent: no warning flush on the way out, because the contract
    promises no message. Nothing is half-written either — a prompt aborts
    before any command does work.

    `Abort` covers an EOF at a prompt as well, which `click` raises the same
    way and does not let us tell apart. That is the same "the user ended it"
    case, and no `bea` prompt uses `abort=True`, so an `Abort` reaching here
