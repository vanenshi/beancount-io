"""`bea upgrade` — hand the update to whichever package manager owns this install.

`bea` has no raw-binary channel: every install is owned by Homebrew, uv, or
pipx, and each of those keeps its own record of what it put on disk. So this
command never touches an installed file itself — it works out which manager
owns the running interpreter and runs that manager's upgrade command. A CLI
that rewrote its own `site-packages` would leave the owning manager describing
a version that is no longer there.
