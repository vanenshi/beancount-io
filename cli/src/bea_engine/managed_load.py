"""Load a ledger with its managed price includes resolved (w1/m29/t003).

One resolution step every load path shares: `check`, `list`, `query`,
`report`, `import`, and write validation all load through here, so no command
sees a different ledger than another. Ledgers without a managed include load
exactly as before — the wrapper detects that case from the include closure
and calls Beancount directly with zero overhead.

Python Beancount resolves includes as filesystem paths, so there is no file
map to overlay onto the way the hosted loader does (ADR 015 section 6).
Instead the wrapper stages a shadow of the include closure beside the
customer's files — the same beside-source staging write validation already
uses, so documents and plugins keep their paths — rewriting each managed
include line to the feed's effective file and loading the staged root. The
customer's files are never touched; entry and error filenames map back to
the originals before anything is returned, while feed entries keep their
cache paths the way hosted entries keep their virtual paths.

Precedence follows ADR 015 section 7 on the feed text: a managed point whose
date and pair collide with a ledger-authored price, directly or reciprocally,
is commented out with its metadata, keeping line numbers stable. The shadowed
count and the dates the engine sees travel in the per-source records for the
status view t004 builds; the effective text is cached per ledger and revision
so the portable export t005 builds reads the same bytes the load parsed.
