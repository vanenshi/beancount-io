# ADR 0007: The MCP surface — one stateless endpoint, and the rules that keep it honest

- Status: Rejected (2026-09-27) — the ledger-pinning policy in D3/D11 is rejected in favor of access to all authorized ledgers for simplicity. See [Rejection rationale](#rejection-rationale-2026-09-27). Cross-surface parity remains in [ADR 0008](./ADR008-backend-v2-surface-parity.md).
- Date: 2026-08-24
- Decision owners: Backend (route, registry, transport, error translation), Deploy (routing, secrets, migrations)
- Scope: `POST /api-gateway/mcp` — the Model Context Protocol endpoint an external agent connects to. What its address is, which HTTP methods it answers, which credentials reach it, how a refusal is phrased, and which deployment facts are part of its contract rather than tribal knowledge. Extends ADR 0006, which established the three-surface model; this ADR is about the third surface specifically.

## Rejection rationale (2026-09-27)

An MCP connection should access **all ledgers the authenticated user is authorized to use**, subject to its granted operation scopes. Connection setup and consent should not require choosing one ledger or a subset. One connection that follows the user's ledger access is simpler to configure and maintain.

This rejects D3's required ledger pin and D11's policy of keeping pins as the default with all-ledger access as an opt-in. Ledger-specific calls still identify their target through a `ledger` argument or resource URI; `listLedgers` provides discovery. Each operation still checks scopes and ledger permissions, including revocation, on every call.

The independent transport, OAuth resource separation, error handling, and schema rules remain valid. The original decisions and diagrams below are retained as history; their ledger-pinning rules no longer describe the intended policy.

**Implementation follow-up:** the current consent flow still offers ledger selection, and target resolution still enforces existing credential pins. This documentation change does not implement the new policy. Removing the MCP ledger-selection flow and handling existing pinned credentials remain implementation work.

## Context

ADR 0006 settled that GraphQL, REST, and MCP are three dialects of one decision: one identity gate (`resolveIdentity`), one op-class table (`op-class.ts`), one rate limiter, one audit hook, and per-feature fragments assembled by `composition-root.ts`. MCP's fragment is `MCP_TOOLS` — seven tools (`runBqlQuery`, `listLedgerFiles`, `readLedgerFiles`, `editLedgerFiles`, `listApiKeys`, `createApiKey`, `revokeApiKey`) — turned into an `McpServer` named `beancount-mcp` by `assembleMcpRegistry`, and served over `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` by `mcp-route.ts`.

That much was decided. What was never written down is everything _around_ the tools: the endpoint's address, its method set, what happens when a credential is refused, and which deployment facts the endpoint silently depends on. Those gaps do not show up in unit tests — the backend's 2596 tests all passed while every one of the following was true in production.

### What a live probe found (2026-08-24)

Read together these are not six unrelated bugs. They are one omission repeated: **the parts of the MCP contract that live outside a tool handler were never anybody's stated responsibility.** The address belonged to the edge, the signing key to the deploy manifest, the migration to an ops runbook, the method set to the SDK's defaults, the refusal dialect to whoever wrote the wrapper. Each was individually defensible and collectively produced an endpoint that no client could reach, authenticate to, or trust the answers from.

## Decision Drivers

- **An MCP client is an agent, not a developer.** It cannot read a runbook, try the other URL, or notice that "success" meant failure. Every ambiguity is resolved wrongly and silently.
- **Failures must be legible at the layer that can fix them.** A hang, a 503 discovery document, and a masked 500 all look identical from the outside — "it doesn't work" — unless the endpoint is specific about which one it is.
- **Nothing may be true of MCP that is not also true of GraphQL and REST**, unless it is written down as an exception with a reason (ADR 0006 D3).
- **Deployment facts the surface depends on belong in the manifest**, where a reviewer sees them, not in an operator's memory.
- **Conformance is a test, not a discipline** — the same standard ADR 0006 D9 set for the other two surfaces.

## Decision

Ten rules. D1–D3 fix the shape of the endpoint, D4–D7 fix what it says when it refuses, D8–D10 fix what must be true before it is considered deployed.

### D1 — One endpoint, one address, and the address is part of the contract

MCP is served at **`POST {issuer}/api-gateway/mcp`** and nowhere else. A friendlier public path (`/mcp`) is permitted only as an **edge alias that reaches the same handler** — never a second mount, and never a path the edge does not actually route.

An unrouted vanity path is worse than no vanity path. `https://beancount.io/mcp` reached the dashboard's SSR catch-all and returned `500 Only HTML requests are supported here`, which tells a client neither that the path is wrong nor that a right one exists. A 404 would have been more useful; a working alias more useful still.

Corollary: the address a client is told to use, the address the edge routes, and the address the router mounts are **three facts that must agree**, and the only way to know they do is to request the public URL. Edge routing is therefore in scope for this ADR, not adjacent to it.

### D2 — The transport is stateless, and the method set follows from that

The transport is constructed with `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`: one `McpServer` and one transport per HTTP request, closed in a `finally`. This is the right default — it needs no session store, no sticky routing, and no eviction policy, and it is what makes a mid-session revocation checkable per call (D5).

Statelessness has a consequence that must be enforced explicitly: **there is no session for a server-initiated stream to belong to.** Therefore:

- `POST` is the only method this endpoint serves.
- `GET` and `DELETE` are answered **`405` with `Allow: POST`**, decided in the route **before a transport is constructed**.

This is what the Streamable HTTP spec prescribes for both — `405` for `GET` when the server offers no stream at the endpoint, and for `DELETE` when it does not let clients terminate sessions — but the concrete reason is sharper than conformance. The SDK's transport does not know it is stateless. It answers `GET` by opening a standalone SSE stream and holding it open, and `handleRequest` does not resolve until that stream ends. The `finally { await server.close() }` therefore never runs, and the stream that would have been closed by it stays open forever. Observed: headers in 14ms, then nothing, connection alive at 8s, one leaked `McpServer` per connection.

**The general rule: never register a route for a method whose handler cannot guarantee the response completes.** A method that hangs is worse than a method that 405s, because a client waiting on a stream has no timeout to distinguish "slow" from "never".

### D3 — Authentication is the shared gate's job; MCP states only its extra requirement

`mcp-route.ts` does not authenticate. It calls `resolveIdentity` with the MCP resource binding from the shared OAuth catalog — the one seam (ADR 0006 D2) — and then decides what an unacceptable _MCP_ credential looks like:

- **A browser session is not an MCP credential.** MCP clients are agents that completed an OAuth ceremony. A session is refused exactly as no credential is, discovery hint included, so a browser-hosted client goes and gets a real token instead of half-working.
- **The credential must be pinned to one ledger.** MCP has no per-call ledger argument to fall back on, so an unpinned token — legitimate on GraphQL and REST — is refused here with a `ForbiddenError` rather than guessed at. API keys are minted with `ledgerScope: "owner/name"` for this reason.

Both refusals are decided _before_ the tool context is built, so an unusable credential never reaches a registry.

MCP and the application API intentionally remain separate OAuth resources. MCP tokens carry `{issuer}/api-gateway/mcp`; Mobile tokens for GraphQL and REST carry the historical `{issuer}/v1` audience. The latter is a protocol identifier, not an HTTP endpoint. An earlier migration direction proposed converging MCP on the application audience, but that would let a credential minted for one trust boundary be replayed at the other. The split is therefore permanent, while `{issuer}/v1` remains stable for released native clients and their persisted refresh grants despite its version-shaped name.

> **Historical amendment:** [D11](#d11--a-credential-may-reach-more-than-one-ledger-and-the-call-says-which) added an optional `ledger` argument and allowed unpinned credentials when a call names its target. Both D3's required pin and D11's default pin were subsequently [rejected on 2026-09-27](#rejection-rationale-2026-09-27). The session-is-not-a-credential rule remains valid.

### D4 — A `401` must hand back a pointer that resolves

Every "go get a proper token" refusal carries the RFC 9728 header:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="{issuer}/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"
```

That is how an unauthenticated MCP client discovers the authorization server, and it is the only discovery mechanism the endpoint offers. It follows that **the protected-resource and authorization-server metadata documents are part of the MCP endpoint's contract, not a neighbouring OAuth feature.**

A deployment that serves the `401` correctly but answers the URL it names with `503 oauth_not_configured` is **broken, not degraded**: the client is handed a pointer into a hole, and no amount of retrying or re-reading gets it a token. Concretely:

- `OAUTH_JWKS` must be declared in **every** production deploy target, not only `deploy/docker-mac`. Without it `oidc-route.ts` swaps every OAuth route for a 503.
- Discovery reachability — `GET {issuer}/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` returns `200` — is a **post-deploy check**, in the same class as "the service is listening".

### D5 — Authorization is per call, never per session

Restating ADR 0006 D4/D9 because the stateless transport is what makes it cheap: every tool authorizes itself, per call, through its service's own `authorizeLedger` seam. `resolveMcpLedgerId` deliberately touches no database — a once-at-connect check could not make a mid-session revocation bite on the next call, and this one does. The scope gate (`requireScopeClass`) and the rate limiter run per call in the handler for the same reason.

### D6 — Every refusal speaks MCP's dialect, and a payload that says `ok:false` **is** a refusal

There are exactly two boundaries, and they use different vocabularies:

- **Before a session exists** — bad address, bad method, no credential, unpinned credential — the answer is an **HTTP status**. The client is not yet in a conversation; there is nothing to interrupt.
- **Inside a tool call** — scope denied, rate limited, ledger revoked, query invalid, file missing — the answer is a **`CallToolResult` with `isError: true`**. A thrown transport error would end the session instead of telling the agent what it lacked, and an agent that is told what it lacked can often fix it.

The rule that was missing: **`isError` must be derived from the result, not only from the control flow.** `runToolSafely` is the tools' error boundary and it _returns_ `{ ok: false, error }` rather than throwing, so a handler that sets `isError` only in its `catch` classifies half the refusals as successes. The two dialects then disagreed with each other — a scope denial (thrown by the gate, outside the boundary) set `isError`, while a revoked ledger grant (thrown inside a service, caught by the boundary) did not. The wrapper must inspect the returned value:

```ts
const failed = typeof result === "object" && result !== null &&
  (result as { ok?: unknown }).ok === false;
return { ...(failed && { isError: true }), content: [...], structuredContent: result };
```

This is the single most consequential rule in this ADR. Every other failure here made the endpoint _unreachable_, which is loud. This one made it **wrong while appearing to work**, which is not: an agent told that a write to a revoked ledger succeeded will report that to a user and carry on.

### D7 — No surface returns an internal error message, and masking lives in one place

An unexpected error's message is written by whatever threw it, for whoever reads logs — not for a client. Drizzle's is the whole SQL statement plus its bound parameters. Because `restErrorMiddleware` wraps `resolveIdentity`, the recipient was an **unauthenticated** caller, who received the `api_keys` query and the digest they had just probed with.

`graphql/format-error.ts` has masked `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` in production since it was written. REST and MCP had not. **Masking is a property of the transport middleware, applied once, identically on all three surfaces**: in production an unexpected error becomes `"Internal server error"` with its category preserved; a `DomainError` keeps its message, because a `DomainError` was written for a client to read. The full message and stack still go to the logger.

### D8 — A tool that returns `structuredContent` declares an `outputSchema`

Every tool returning `structuredContent` publishes the schema for it, so a client can validate what it receives instead of trusting it. The uniform shape is the contract worth publishing: a client branches on `ok` rather than string-matching.

**The obvious implementation is a trap, and it fails loudly in the wrong place.** Each tool already defines its schema as a discriminated union (`toolOutputSchema`), so registering that union looks like a one-line change. It is not: the MCP SDK normalizes a tool's `outputSchema` through `normalizeObjectSchema`, which returns an object schema **or nothing at all** — a union normalizes to `undefined`. The result is strictly worse than declaring no schema: `tools/list` advertises nothing _and_ every call fails with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_zod')`, because the output validator dereferences what the normalizer declined to produce. Verified against `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.0.

So `mcpOutputSchema` derives the publishable form from that same union: `ok` widens from a literal discriminant to a plain boolean, and both payload members become optional. The **payload does not change** — a result still arrives as `{ ok: true, result }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. Only the published description loosens, trading the union's "`ok: true` implies `result`" for a schema that exists at all; field descriptions carry the implication the schema can no longer state. Deriving rather than hand-writing keeps one source of truth, and the helper throws at construction if the union ever stops having an `ok: true` branch — publishing nothing is the failure it exists to prevent, so it must not be able to fail silently.

Note the interaction with D6: an `isError` result skips output validation in the SDK, so the two rules compose rather than conflict — publishing a schema does not start rejecting refusals.

### D9 — Conformance is tested, and transport behavior is tested against a real socket

Three properties must be guarded, in the style ADR 0006 D9 set:

1. **Method set** — `GET` and `DELETE` return `405` + `Allow: POST`; an _unauthenticated_ `GET` still returns `401` with the discovery hint, not `405`, so discovery is not lost to the method check; an unpinned credential still returns `403`.
2. **Refusal dialect** — both a gate denial and an in-tool refusal produce `isError: true`. One test per dialect, in the same suite, because a surface that quietly stopped enforcing looks identical to one where the caller happened to be allowed.
3. **Error masking** — an unexpected error is masked in production; a `DomainError` is not.

Property 1 must be exercised **through a real HTTP server and a real socket, draining the response body**. The hang in D2 was invisible to every form of test that does not have to finish reading a response: headers arrived in 14ms and looked perfect. A fabricated `ctx` cannot express "the response never ended", which is precisely why the bug survived a suite this size.

### D10 — Required secrets and schema migrations gate the surface, and both are declared where a reviewer sees them

The endpoint depends on two deployment facts that no code path can supply:

- **`OAUTH_JWKS`** — declared in every production manifest (`bex.yaml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`), not only the local stack. Absent it, D4's discovery chain dead-ends.
- **The `api_keys` and `audit_events` tables** (migrations `0018`, `0019`) — the second credential kind and the audit hook. On the hosted target migrations run from inside a running instance (`bex ssh` → `yarn migrate:deploy`), because the pre-deploy job cannot reach the datastore across namespaces; that is a documented constraint, which makes "did they run?" a **release checklist item**, not an assumption.

Both fell through the same crack: `backend-v2/AGENTS.md` already requires a new environment variable to be added to `.env.example`, the README, the local compose file, _and_ `bex.yaml`. `OAUTH_JWKS` reached the README and `deploy/docker-mac` — and stopped there. It was in neither `.env.example` nor either production manifest, so the one deployment that actually needed it was the one place it was never written down. The checklist was right; nothing enforced it.

### D11 — A credential may reach more than one ledger, and the call says which

> **Ledger-pinning policy rejected on 2026-09-27.** The following describes the earlier design and its tradeoffs. See [Rejection rationale](#rejection-rationale-2026-09-27) for the intended all-ledger policy.

D3's pin is kept as the default and stops being the only mode. The four ledger tools take an optional `ledger` argument (`owner/name`), resolved in this order:

| Credential | `ledger` argument | Result                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| pinned     | absent            | the pin — **today's behaviour, bit for bit** |
| pinned     | equals the pin    | allowed                                      |
| pinned     | any other ledger  | **refused.** A pin never widens              |
| unpinned   | present           | that ledger, authorized on this call         |
| unpinned   | absent            | refused, with a message naming `listLedgers` |

Three things make this smaller than it looks:

- **`authorizeLedger` needs no change.** It already takes the ledger id as a per-call argument (D5) — the seam that makes mid-session revocation bite is the same seam that makes a per-call ledger safe. Nothing about authorization moves.
- **`resolveMcpLedgerId` stops being a gate and becomes a default.** It is the only place in the route that has to change.
- **Nothing existing breaks.** A pinned credential that never sends the argument behaves exactly as it does today, so every live client keeps working and the change is purely additive.

**`listLedgers` becomes a tool**, reversing its `mcpExempt` — which read _"Not agent-shaped: no agent workflow reaches for it."_ That was true, and it was true **only because of D3's pin**: with exactly one reachable ledger, listing them is a tool that can only ever return the answer the agent already had. The moment a credential can reach several, it is the first call an agent has to make. See ADR 0008 D3 — an exemption inherited from a constraint has to be re-derived when that constraint moves, and this is the worked example.

#### What this gives up, stated plainly

For a **pinned** credential nothing changes: the agent still cannot write to the wrong book, and that is still enforced by the token rather than by the model choosing correctly.

For an **unpinned** one, that guarantee is genuinely weaker. "Do not write to the wrong ledger" moves from the credential to the model's choice of argument, and `editLedgerFiles` commits. That is a real reduction in safety, not a neutral generalization, and it is why unpinned is opt-in rather than the default: a client that wants the strong property keeps it by minting a pinned key, which stays the documented recommendation for anything unattended.

Three things blunt the remaining edge, none of which removes it: `editLedgerFiles` already has `dry_run`; every tool result should echo the ledger it acted on, so a wrong choice is visible in the transcript rather than silent; and the audit trail already records the ledger per call.

#### Why not the alternatives

- **A ledger-selection tool that sets session state** — impossible as specified: the transport is stateless by D2, one server per request. There is no session to hold the selection.
- **One endpoint per ledger** (`/api-gateway/mcp/{owner}/{name}`) — would keep the token-enforced property for every mode, since each path is its own RFC 8707 resource. Rejected for now because it multiplies endpoints, discovery documents, and audiences by the number of ledgers a user owns, and because a client would have to be reconfigured whenever a ledger is added. Worth revisiting if the unpinned mode proves too loose in practice.
- **Making every tool take a required `ledger`** — would break every pinned credential in use and move the safety property from "cannot" to "should not" for all clients, not just the ones that opted in.

```

## Alternatives Considered

### Stateful sessions with `Mcp-Session-Id` and an event store (rejected for now)

Would make `GET` meaningful — a standalone stream for server-initiated notifications, and `Last-Event-ID` resumability. It costs a session store, sticky routing or a shared backplane, an eviction policy, and it reopens the question D5 closes: a long-lived session invites a once-at-connect authorization check. Nothing in the current tool set pushes to the client, so the capability would be scaffolding for a use case we do not have. Revisit when a tool needs to notify (long-running imports are the plausible first).

### Keep `GET` registered and let the transport answer it (rejected)

This _is_ the bug. The transport cannot know the endpoint is stateless, and its default answer is a stream that never ends and never closes.

### Return `405` from `router.allowedMethods()` instead of the handler (rejected)

Simpler, and wrong on ordering: `allowedMethods()` fires before authentication, so an unauthenticated `GET` would receive `405` instead of the `401` that carries the discovery pointer. D4 depends on that pointer being reachable by a client holding nothing. Authenticate first, then refuse the method.

### Let `runToolSafely` throw instead of returning `{ok:false}` (rejected)

Would make the handler's `catch` sufficient and D6 unnecessary. But the same executors are shared with the chat/agent routes, where the returned envelope is the contract, and ADR 0006 D1's whole point is that a verb behaves identically wherever it is invoked. Classifying at the MCP boundary is the smaller change and keeps the shared shape.

### Mask REST errors only for unauthenticated callers (rejected)

Tempting — the leak is worst pre-authentication — but "who is asking" is exactly what an unexpected error means we could not establish. The masking must not depend on the thing that failed.

### Serve MCP from the dashboard, or from a dedicated service (rejected)

MCP's authorization is the backend's authorization; a second implementation is a second place for it to drift. ADR 0006 D1 already settled that a tool and a resolver invoking the same verb must get identical authorization and identical data.

## Conformance checklist

A deploy is not "MCP-ready" until all seven hold. `yarn mcp:conformance <base-url>` checks them:

1. `POST {issuer}/api-gateway/mcp` returns `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…` header.
2. The URL that header names returns `200` with a valid RFC 9728 document.
3. `GET` and `DELETE` on the endpoint return `405` with `Allow: POST` for an authenticated caller, and complete.
4. A ledger-scoped `bcio_` key reaches `initialize` and `tools/list`, returning 7 tools.
5. A ledger-scoped key with `ledger.read` only receives `isError: true` for `editLedgerFiles`.
6. An unexpected internal error returns `"Internal server error"`, with the detail in logs only.
7. The public URL advertised to users is one of the addresses above, verified by requesting it.

## Implementation review (2026-09-27)

- **D1's canonical address is established.** [Client documentation](../../backend-cluster/backend-v2/docs/mcp.md) uses `/api-gateway/mcp`, and [ADR 019's 2026-09-25 probe](./ADR019-backend-v2-mcp-host-compatibility.md#what-a-probe-found-2026-09-25) records the public endpoint and its working discovery chain. The optional `/mcp` alias is not required for completion.
- **D11's earlier design is implemented.** [MCP tools](../../backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-tools.ts) expose `listLedgers` and optional per-call ledger selection; [target resolution](../../backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-context.ts) preserves pins and refuses an omitted unpinned target. This shipped with [w1/m10](../../.pm/w1/done/m10/README.md), before the ledger-pinning policy was rejected above.
- **D10 deployment closeout is not verified by this review.** The migrations and conformance script are present, but a source review and passing local tests do not establish that the production database has both tables or that authenticated production conformance passes. This remains a deployment verification item, separate from the rejection of ledger pinning.

The dated implementation account below is historical, including its statements that D11 is unimplemented and production API keys do not work; neither is a current finding from this review.

## Implementation status (2026-08-24)

**Already in force before this ADR** — written down here rather than newly decided: D3 (the credential rules in `mcp-route.ts`) and D5 (per-call authorization, from ADR 0006 D4/D9).

**Landed in this change:**

- D2 — `GET`/`DELETE` refused `405 + Allow: POST` before a transport exists (`mcp-route.ts`), with the socket-level regression test D9 requires.
- D6 — `isError` derived from the result payload (`composition-root.ts`), with a test covering the in-tool refusal dialect alongside the existing gate-denial one.
- D7 — production masking in `restErrorMiddleware`, mirroring `format-error.ts`, with tests for both the masked and unmasked cases.
- D9 — all three properties now guarded; each test was verified to fail against the code as it stood before its fix.
- D10 (partial) — `OAUTH_JWKS` declared in `bex.yaml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example`, completing the checklist it had half-followed.

**Landed with w3/m4 (2026-08-24):**

- D8 — `mcpOutputSchema` in `tools/types.ts`, an `outputSchema` on every descriptor, passed through `assembleMcpRegistry`.
- The conformance checklist below is now executable: `yarn mcp:conformance <base-url> [--token …] [--read-only-token …]` runs all seven checks against any deployment, names the check that failed, skips (rather than fails) what it has no credential for, and only observes. Credential-gated checks that an operator often cannot exercise by hand are covered by tests against a real socket.
- `backend-cluster/backend-v2/README.md` documents connecting a client; the root `README.md` surfaces it.

**Landed with w5/028 (2026-10-03):**

- D7 on MCP — the masking the rule requires of all three surfaces had landed only on REST. The MCP boundary (`mcp-errors.ts`, applied in `composition-root.ts`) now replaces the message of an unexpected failure with `"Internal server error"` in production on tool calls, resource reads, and prompt fetches, keeping its category and hint. A `DomainError`, an argument refusal, and a tool guard's own not-found keep their message; the full message still goes to the logger. Covered through the real registry in `mcp-unexpected-error-masking.test.ts`.

**Landed on the deployment side (verified 2026-08-25):**

- D4 — `OAUTH_JWKS` is seeded. `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` both return `200`, `/api-gateway/oauth/jwks` serves an ES256 key, and dynamic client registration works. An MCP client can now complete the OAuth ceremony end to end; a browser consent step is the only part a script cannot drive.

**Outstanding — requires production access or a follow-up change:**

- D1 — a working public path for `/mcp`, either as an edge alias or by leaving `/api-gateway/mcp` as the documented address. The REST surface hit the same problem — the edge routes only `/api-gateway/*` — and `fix(backend-v2): move REST v1 under API gateway` settled it by moving the mount under the gateway rather than widening the edge, making `/api-gateway/v1/…` the one correct address. That move is not available to MCP, which already sits there, so this one is genuinely an edge decision.
- D10 — apply migrations `0018`/`0019` to the production database, and run `yarn mcp:conformance` as a post-deploy step.
- D11 — the optional `ledger` argument on the four ledger tools, the `listLedgers` tool, and turning `resolveMcpLedgerId` from a gate into a default. Additive: no live client changes behaviour. Reversing `Query.listLedgers`'s `mcpExempt` is part of this, not a separate cleanup.

The remaining production gap is D10 alone, and it is narrower than it was: **OAuth works, API keys do not.** `resolveApiKeyIdentity` queries `api_keys` only for `bcio_`-prefixed tokens, so a `bcio_` credential still returns `500` on the missing table while an OAuth token never touches that path. A human at a browser can connect today; CI, cron, and unattended clients cannot until the migration runs.

## Open Questions

- Should `scopeEnforcement` flip from `"shadow"` to `"enforce"` before or after MCP is publicly advertised? Advertising first means the first external clients are the traffic the shadow mode is meant to observe — which is either the point or exactly backwards.
- Is a `/mcp` alias worth the edge configuration, or is `/api-gateway/mcp` fine as the documented address? The alias is friendlier in a config file a human types once.
- Should the conformance checklist run as an automated post-deploy smoke test rather than a document?
