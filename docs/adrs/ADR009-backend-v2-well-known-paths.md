# ADR: `.well-known` paths — one index for every one of them

- Status: Done (path index and implementation reviewed 2026-09-27; `/.well-known/mcp-registry-auth` added 2026-10-03)
- Date: 2026-08-25
- Decision owners: Backend (`backend-cluster/backend-v2`)
- Scope: every `/.well-known/*` path served by, proxied to, or referenced about Beancount.io. What exists today, who serves it, and every file that has to change together when a path is added or moved.

## Context

Beancount.io's `.well-known` traffic includes OAuth/OIDC discovery (RFC 8414 + RFC 9728), RFC 9116 security contact metadata, and MCP client discovery. The implementation is correctly centralized in the backend's well-known route files, but the _knowledge_ of these paths is not: the OAuth routes live in `oidc-route.ts`, the migrated security and MCP routes live in `well-known-route.ts`, their public-access justification lives in `always-public.ts`, their rate-limit bucket lives in `rate-limit.ts`, the dev proxy that forwards them lives in `dashboard/vite.config.ts`, a client-side mirror of the OAuth URL-building logic lives in `mobile/src/common/oauth/discovery.ts`, and deployment warnings about what breaks when OAuth discovery 503s are duplicated across `bex.yaml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example`. Nothing tied these together, so a new well-known path could be added to a route file without anyone updating the proxy, the gate census, or the deployment docs.

This ADR is that index. It does not re-implement or re-decide anything — `oidc-route.ts` is still the source of truth for behavior, and [ADR0007 D4](./ADR007-backend-v2-mcp-surface.md) is still the source of truth for _why_ the MCP endpoint depends on this discovery chain. This document exists so the full set of paths, and the full set of places a change to them touches, is readable in one place.

When OAuth signing keys are absent (`config.oauth.jwks` unset), all three OAuth discovery routes are replaced with a `503 oauth_not_configured` handler instead of removed — the path still exists, it just can't answer (the early no-JWKS branch in `setOidcRoutes`).

### How the issuer path segment works

`oauthWellKnownPath(kind, absoluteUrl)` (`oidc-route.ts`) and its client-side mirror `wellKnownUrl` (`mobile/src/common/oauth/discovery.ts`) both compute `/.well-known/{kind}[/{path}]`, where `{path}` is the given URL's pathname with leading/trailing slashes stripped. This is what lets one backend serve discovery documents for multiple issuer prefixes (multi-tenant ledger owners). Example, from `README.md`, for issuer `https://books.example.test/beancount`:

```text
resource:                       https://books.example.test/beancount/v1
protected resource metadata:    https://books.example.test/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/beancount/v1
authorization server metadata:  https://books.example.test/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/beancount
```

In production, where the issuer has no extra path segment, the three paths collapse to the literal forms in the table above.

## Touchpoints — what else changes when a well-known path is added or moved

1. **Route** — `backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/features/oauth/api/oidc-route.ts` for OAuth/OIDC paths, or `backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/features/well-known/api/well-known-route.ts` for security and MCP discovery. OAuth routes also have an `unavailable` twin in the no-JWKS branch.
2. **Scope gate census** — `backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/server/api/always-public.ts`. Every well-known op needs an entry with a written reason; `__tests__/always-public.test.ts` fails in both directions (undocumented mount, or stale entry) if it's missing or wrong.
3. **Rate limiter** — `backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/server/api/rate-limit.ts` buckets any path containing `/.well-known/` under the shared `"oauth"` budget. A path that doesn't literally contain that substring won't get it.
4. **MCP's discovery pointer** — `backend-cluster/backend-v2/src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-route.ts` names `{issuer}/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` in the `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="..."` header on every 401. Moving that path without updating this header breaks MCP client discovery per ADR0007 D4.
5. **Dashboard dev proxy** — `dashboard/vite.config.ts` forwards `/.well-known/**` (wildcard) to the backend at `localhost:4104`. New paths under `/.well-known/` are covered automatically; a well-known path served from somewhere other than backend-v2 would not be.
6. **Mobile client mirror** — `mobile/src/common/oauth/discovery.ts` reimplements the same path-building logic for the mobile app's own discovery flow. Keep it and `oauthWellKnownPath` in sync; both have their own test file (`__tests__/discovery.test.ts`, `oidc-route.test.ts`).
7. **Deployment secret docs** — `bex.yaml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`, and `backend-cluster/backend-v2/.env.example` each carry a comment warning that missing `OAUTH_JWKS` makes `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` answer `503`, which breaks MCP authentication. Update all three if the warning's target path changes.
8. **SEO / analytics exclusion** — `dashboard/scripts/search-console-report-core.ts` classifies `/.well-known` under `apiPrefixes` so Search Console reporting doesn't misattribute discovery-document traffic to dashboard-owned pages (see `dashboard/AGENTS.md`).
9. **Backend README** — `backend-cluster/backend-v2/README.md`'s "OAuth deployment contract" section is the canonical worked example of the issuer → resource → well-known path chain; update it if the derivation logic changes.
10. **ADR0007** — `docs/adrs/ADR007-backend-v2-mcp-surface.md` D4 documents _why_ the protected-resource document is part of MCP's contract rather than a neighbouring OAuth feature. This ADR indexes the paths; ADR0007 explains that one consequence in depth. Don't duplicate its prose here.

## Not here: token introspection

`POST /api-gateway/v1/token/introspect` (RFC 7662, [ADR 0017](./ADR017-backend-v2-token-introspection.md)) is deliberately **not** advertised as `introspection_endpoint` in the authorization-server metadata, and adds no path to the table above.

Recorded here because the absence looks like an oversight otherwise. That field names the authorization server's own introspection endpoint, which RFC 7662 §2.1 and RFC 8414 together tell a client to reach with OAuth client credentials, about OAuth tokens. Ours does neither: it authenticates through the product's identity gate and answers about three credential kinds, two of which this authorization server never issued. A discovery-driven client that found it there would send client credentials we reject. ADR 0017 D9 has the full argument; the endpoint is documented in `backend-cluster/backend-v2/README.md` instead, beside the offline JWKS path so an integrator picks between them deliberately.

Nothing in the touchpoint list applies to it: it adds no `.well-known` path, changes no path-building logic, and needs no change to the dev proxy or the mobile discovery mirror.

## Decision

Keep this file as the single list of every `.well-known` path in the system and the files that reference it. Adding, renaming, or removing a well-known path is not done until every touchpoint above is updated and this table reflects the result.
