# w1 — General adoption worker queue (worker1)

**Worker:** worker1 — general-purpose adoption worker; accepts the next highest-impact milestone across packages, topics, and A1/A2/A3 rather than owning a permanent specialty. Existing milestones retain their historical order and source.

## Milestones

Milestones m1–m23 are complete; no pending ADR014 follow-up milestones remain from that run. The block m23–m27 and m29 was materialized on 2026-09-16 from `/pm-brainstorm for w1`: five of them absorb the 2026-09-15/16 continuous CLI QA sweep by shared root cause rather than one note at a time, and m29 carries promoted work from w2/027. m23–m27 and m29 have shipped. There is no m28 — see `## Dropped`.

**Suggested order:** m25 → m26 → m27 → m29. The five CLI-sweep milestones are independent of one another and can be taken in any order; m23 shipped first because it fixes a silent ledger-wipe path (`w3/300`, critical) and establishes the exit contract the others are tested against. m29 is the non-sweep item and depends on nothing in this queue.

### Open

- [x] **m25** — [Every failure is a JSON envelope, and empty inputs are errors](./done/m25/README.md) (9 tasks) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w1` 2026-09-16 item 3; absorbs 24 CLI QA notes from w3 plus w5/004
- [x] **m26** — [Ledgers survive Windows editors and Unicode](./done/m26/README.md) (9 tasks) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w1` 2026-09-16 item 4; absorbs 9 CLI QA notes from w3
- [x] **m27** — [Amounts are exact on the way in and out](./done/m27/README.md) (10 tasks) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w1` 2026-09-16 item 5; absorbs 10 CLI QA notes from w3
- [x] **m29** — [`bea` resolves managed price includes locally](./done/m29/README.md) (10 tasks) ← promoted [w2/027](../w2/027.md); ADR 015 + PRFAQ002

## Dropped

- ~~**m28**~~ — Read-after-delete consistency for hosted slice deletes — dropped 2026-09-16: proposed by `/pm-brainstorm for w1` as a promotion of `w1/033`, but never materialized as open work. Triage the same day established that every layer of the delete path in this monorepo already applies synchronously — backend-v2 awaits the ledger-service call, the ledger service awaits a Gitea CAS commit with bounded retry, reads resolve live HEAD per load, and backend-v2 caches no journal or context read — so there is no async-apply code here to fix and no in-monorepo change can be proven against the acceptance. The work is still wanted and waits with its full record and **Unblock:** condition at [blocked/033](./blocked/033.md), which needs hosted diagnosis naming the lagging layer. Promoting it into a milestone would have duplicated that note and put unbuildable work in the open tree.

## Inbox


The three MCP QA findings filed on 2026-09-21/22 were drained on 2026-09-23: [035](./done/035.md), [036](./done/036.md), and [037](./done/037.md) shipped with regression coverage.

The four mobile QA findings filed on 2026-09-16 were drained the same day: [031](./done/031.md), [032](./done/032.md), and [034](./done/034.md) shipped with regression coverage, and [033](./blocked/033.md) is blocked.

## Blocked

Blocked notes live under [`blocked/`](./blocked/) with their reason and **Unblock:** condition; they keep their IDs and return to the open tree when work can resume.

- [033](./blocked/033.md) — Slice-delete success precedes removal by minutes; a refetch resurrects the row — **blocked:** no async-apply code exists in this monorepo and the acceptance cannot be proven here. **Unblock:** hosted diagnosis naming the lagging layer, or a local full-stack repro. Cleared by the user (hosted access plus QA credentials).

## Absorbed CLI QA notes (m23–m27)

The 2026-09-15/16 continuous CLI QA sweep filed 151 findings in `w3`. Eighty-two of them share five root-cause classes and are absorbed by m23–m27 rather than drained one at a time; each absorbed note carries a **Promoted** disposition line naming its milestone and task, and stays open in `w3` as the reproducer of record until that milestone's closeout closes it with `/pm done`. The remaining `w3` notes have heterogeneous causes and stay in that queue for `/loopx w3`.

**Coordination with `/loopx w3`.** A concurrent drain of `w3` is fixing some of these notes individually, which is fine and is not wasted work — but it means an absorbed note may already be shipped by the time its milestone is picked up. The rule: before starting any task in m23–m27, check whether its absorbed notes already sit in `w3/done/`; if one does, read the shipped fix and its regression test first, then narrow the task to what is genuinely left. At closeout, a task whose work landed that way is closed with a `## Closed by triage` section citing the commit and tests, per `.agents/skills/pm/SKILL.md`. A milestone keeps its value even when most of its notes arrive pre-fixed, because the shared contract, the matrix test and the documentation are the parts no individual note fix delivers — but if every note in a cluster is fixed and that contract already holds, close the milestone rather than inventing work for it.

Already fixed by `/loopx w3` as of 2026-09-16 (fourteen of the eighty-two, plus w5/003 and w5/004, all now in their queues' `done/`): m23 — w3/236, 249. m24 — w3/226, 227, 237. m25 — w3/233, 234, 238, 239, 250. m26 — w3/248, 251, 252. m27 — w3/240. This list is a snapshot, not a ledger; re-check `w3/done/` at pickup time.
