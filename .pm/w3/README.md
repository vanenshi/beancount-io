# w3 — General adoption worker queue (worker3)

**Worker:** worker3 — general-purpose adoption worker; accepts the next highest-impact milestone across packages, topics, and A1/A2/A3 rather than owning a permanent specialty. Existing milestones retain their historical order and source.

## Dropped

- ~~**446**~~ — Ask-AI quota/cap mismatch — superseded 2026-10-02 by [m52](./blocked/m52/README.md); the complete evidence is retained in its source note, public proxy fixes shipped, and shared-provider accounting has an explicit external unblock condition.

- ~~**439**~~ — `--offline` with no cached revision reports the cause as `None` — dropped 2026-09-26: not a separate defect. Same six lines of `cli/src/bea_engine/managed_load.py` (~399–405) as [433](./done/433.md), which now carries both symptoms and the full record; one fix covers both.
- ~~**453**~~ — One server-side failure ends the whole `bea ask` session — dropped 2026-09-26: not a separate defect. Same five lines of `cli/src/cli/ask/repl.py` (225–233) as [449](./done/449.md), which now carries both triggers and the full record; both notes already said they belonged in one pass.

## Blocked

Blocked milestones and inbox notes live under [`blocked/`](./blocked/) with their reason and **Unblock:** condition; they keep their IDs and return to the open tree when work can resume.

- [ ] **m1** / **m2** — see milestone lines above (in-app budget verification).
- [003](./blocked/003.md) — Bulk entry writes are not retry-safe after a false timeout — **blocked:** needs an idempotency contract across REST, GraphQL and MCP.
- [113](./blocked/113.md) — Lot reductions replace current market prices — **blocked:** upstream `@rustledger/wasm` (still 0.24.0); vendoring forbidden.

- [x] **m43** — Open shared native transaction links in a browser (6 tasks) ← native QA Sep13
