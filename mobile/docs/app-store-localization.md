# Localized App Store release workflow

Beancount ships 13 in-app languages. Apple accepts 11 of those languages as
App Store metadata through 14 regional localizations:

| Runtime language   | App Store localization(s) | Notes                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| English            | `en-US`                   | Primary listing and fallback                                    |
| Simplified Chinese | `zh-Hans`                 | Native listing                                                  |
| Catalan            | `ca`                      | Native listing                                                  |
| German             | `de-DE`                   | Native listing                                                  |
| Spanish            | `es-ES`, `es-MX`          | Region-specific terminology and search intent                   |
| French             | `fr-FR`, `fr-CA`          | Region-specific terminology and search intent                   |
| Dutch              | `nl-NL`                   | Native listing                                                  |
| Portuguese         | `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`          | Region-specific terminology and search intent                   |
| Russian            | `ru`                      | Native listing                                                  |
| Slovak             | `sk`                      | Native listing                                                  |
| Ukrainian          | `uk`                      | Native listing                                                  |
| Bulgarian          | —                         | Apple offers no `bg` metadata; inherits primary `en-US` listing |
| Persian            | —                         | Apple offers no `fa` metadata; inherits primary `en-US` listing |

`metadata/store-locales.json` is the authoritative mapping. Do not map
Bulgarian or Persian to an unrelated storefront locale, and do not add extra
English variants solely to obtain more keyword fields.

## Positioning and terminology

Every locale tells the same supported story, in this order:

1. Financial clarity: net worth, spending, budgets, cash flow, and reports.
2. Ownership: real Beancount plain-text files with Git history and direct editing.
3. Accounting depth: double-entry postings, multiple books and currencies,
   investments, receipt capture, search, and filters.

Listing terminology follows the shipped translations under `src/translations/`.
Regional variants are intentional: Spain uses _informes_ and _flujo de caja_,
Mexico uses _reportes_ and _flujo de efectivo_; France uses _patrimoine net_ and
_trésorerie_, Canada uses _valeur nette_ and _flux de trésorerie_; Brazil uses
_arquivo_, _celular_, and _patrimônio_, while Portugal uses _ficheiro_,
_telemóvel_, and _património_.

The first three screenshot captions mirror the same hierarchy. Their sources
are the deterministic public demo ledger in `docs/marketing-showcase/webp/`—not
a signed-in contributor account. The renderer replaces visible UI labels with
the corresponding shipped strings from `src/translations/`, then adds each
storefront's native caption. `metadata/screenshots.json` owns locale, device,
story, caption, source, dimensions, and order.

## Prepare locally

Never start by editing the version currently in review. Wait for it to reach a
terminal store state, then prepare a subsequent version locally before pushing
the version bump to `main`:

```zsh
cd mobile

# Optional read-only baseline; pull into ignored tmp/ so approved work is not overwritten.
mkdir -p tmp/asc-baseline
asc metadata pull --app 1527950512 --version <current-version> \
  --platform IOS --dir tmp/asc-baseline --force --output table

yarn bump
# Replace every blank metadata/version/<new-version>/* whatsNew and the new
# fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<build>.txt placeholder.

yarn metadata:validate
yarn screenshots:build
yarn screenshots:validate
```

`yarn bump` keeps `package.json`, Expo, iOS, and Android versions in sync. It
scaffolds all 14 version-localization files from `metadata/version-template/`
and deliberately blanks every `whatsNew`; validation fails until all localized
release notes are fresh. The Android changelog path remains intact. Fastlane is
not an iOS metadata authority.

Generated screenshot PNGs and raw comparison renders are ignored. The build
creates 84 final Apple assets: 14 locales × `APP_IPHONE_65` and
`APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129` × three ordered stories. It strips alpha and uses
Apple-accepted `1284×2778` and `2064×2752` output sizes. The release plan runs
`asc screenshots validate` against every one of the 28 locale/device sets as
the upstream preflight. Because Apple accepts the iPad dimensions for multiple
display-type aliases, the review manifest pins each asset to the exact device
declared in `metadata/screenshots.json` before planning.

## Review-gated App Store Connect changes

Authentication belongs in the system keychain, or ignored `.asc/` state. Never
print, copy, or commit a token, credential identifier, or review artifact.

The release helper separates every remote mutation. The exact version must be
repeated as the third argument for `create`, `approve`, `apply-metadata`, and
`apply-screenshots`:

```zsh
# 1. Explicitly authorize creation of the editable record. This copies only
# stable metadata from the prior live version, excludes release notes, and
# pre-creates the manifest's blank version-localization resources so ASC can
# plan app-info and version changes without a cross-resource creation race.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh create <new-version> <new-version>

# 2. Read-only remote diff plus local screenshot review artifacts.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh plan <new-version>

# 3. Inspect metadata/plan.md, metadata/keywords-plan.md, and
# screenshots/index.html under .asc/releases/<new-version>/. After operator
# approval, record the local approvals.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh approve <new-version> <new-version>

# 4. Apply the reviewed metadata first. This creates the version-localization
# resources that screenshot planning needs.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh apply-metadata <new-version> <new-version>

# 5. Generate and inspect screenshots/plan.md now that all locales exist remotely.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh plan-screenshots <new-version>

# 6. Apply only the separately reviewed screenshot replacement plan.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh apply-screenshots <new-version> <new-version>

# 7. Pull remote metadata into ignored tmp/ and verify metadata, keywords, and
# screenshot source checksums, dimensions, processing state, and order.
./scripts/app-store-release.sh verify <new-version>
```

The helper refuses a missing/non-editable version, missing review artifacts, or
an inexact confirmation. Screenshot application uses upstream `asc screenshots
plan` and `asc screenshots apply --confirm --replace`; no repository code
handles bearer tokens or App Store upload requests.

A replacement release can reuse a withdrawn version record in
`DEVELOPER_REJECTED`, which Apple permits editing, as well as a new record in
`PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`. The same plans, approvals, exact-version confirmation,
and parity checks apply. Verification reads the current remote state into the
receipt; it never labels a withdrawn record as a new draft. Versions awaiting
or undergoing review remain blocked.

Diff `tmp/asc-parity-<version>/app-info/` and
`tmp/asc-parity-<version>/version/<version>/` against the canonical files. Also
list every remote screenshot set and verify locale, display type, processed
state, count, dimensions, and order. The `verify` action performs those checks
and writes `metadata/releases/<version>.json`, a non-secret staging receipt tied
to a SHA-256 digest of the exact canonical metadata, screenshot manifest, and
public source captures, shipped UI translations, and screenshot renderer. Only
after metadata, screenshot source checksums, and keyword parity are clean
should that receipt and the version bump reach `main`. The release workflow
rejects a missing or stale receipt before it starts the EAS build and
auto-submit for an untagged version.

## Google Play listing

Play coverage is defined by `runtimeToPlay` in `metadata/store-locales.json`:
16 storefronts cover all 13 runtime languages. `playToStore` reuses canonical
Apple copy/captions where a matching localization exists. Bulgarian (`bg`) and
Persian (`fa`) have their own Play captions, without changing Apple's fallback
policy. These are the intended targets; they do not prove the listing is live.

Before generating Play listing copy, pull the actual listing baseline with the
service account used by EAS Submit. Keep the key outside the repository or under
ignored `tmp/`; pass only its path:

```zsh
export GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=/absolute/path/to/service-account.json
yarn play:baseline
```

The command prints each existing locale's text presence and phone/feature image
counts, and saves public listing text and image metadata to
`tmp/play-baseline/baseline.json`. Authentication uses Node's built-in RSA signing
and HTTP support. It creates an edit, reads the listing, and deletes the edit
without committing. Do not run it concurrently with another Play edit using the
same account. Authentication error output excludes response bodies and request
diagnostics. The baseline, key, and tokens must never be committed.

`yarn screenshots:build` also renders three 1080×1920 phone screenshots and one
1024×500 feature graphic per Play locale. `metadata/screenshots.json` holds the
Play display targets and Bulgarian/Persian captions alongside the existing Apple
stories. All generated PNGs remain ignored. Chromium renders the Play typography
and Persian UI overlays with Unicode shaping; ImageMagick produces opaque PNGs.
For Apple captions and demo overlays, Arial Unicode MS is preferred when
available. macOS runners can instead use Arial for Latin/Cyrillic and Heiti SC
for Chinese; the build rejects missing font coverage.
Current Homebrew installations need `imagemagick-full` for font discovery:
`brew install imagemagick-full`, then put `$(brew --prefix imagemagick-full)/bin`
on `PATH`. The CI job does this explicitly.
Set `CHROME_BIN` to a Chromium/headless-shell executable if needed. The renderer
otherwise looks for an existing Playwright headless-shell installation, then
Chrome on macOS or `chromium` on Linux. No browser package is installed by the
build. All image sources are embedded local public demo assets.

```zsh
yarn screenshots:build
yarn screenshots:validate
# Focused visual review during development:
LOCALE=fa DISPLAY_TYPE=phoneScreenshots yarn screenshots:build
LOCALE=bg DISPLAY_TYPE=featureGraphic yarn screenshots:build
```

The full validator checks both storefront matrices, filename order, dimensions,
and absence of an alpha channel. Review the phone sets and feature graphics at
their actual size before any upload. Play's locale codes and image requirements
are documented in [Google's localization guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9844778)
and [preview asset requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9866151).

### Generate, review, apply, verify

After inspecting the baseline, run `yarn play:generate`. This emits 16 public
`metadata/play/<locale>.json` files from the current `metadata/app-info` and
`metadata/version/<version>` inputs. Bulgarian and Persian canonical copy lives
in `metadata/play-source/` because Apple has no corresponding localizations.
Short descriptions combine subtitle and promotional text, trimmed to complete clauses where possible and otherwise at Unicode
word boundaries. `yarn metadata:validate` checks the 30/80/4000-character limits,
complete locale coverage, and generated-copy drift. Run generation after each
version bump or canonical listing edit; do not hand-edit generated Play files.

```zsh
yarn play:generate
yarn metadata:validate
yarn screenshots:build
yarn screenshots:validate
./scripts/play-release.sh plan-play
```

Planning is offline and needs no credential. It writes `tmp/play-release/plan.txt`
and `plan.json`, including every locale's text diff, image replacement counts,
ordered filenames and SHA-256 hashes. Inspect those artifacts and the images.
After operator authorization for the reviewed listing changes:

```zsh
./scripts/play-release.sh apply-play <plan-sha256>
./scripts/play-release.sh verify-play
```

The SHA-256 is printed by the plan command. Apply rejects stale local inputs or
a changed remote baseline. It replaces the phone screenshots and feature graphic,
updates title and descriptions while preserving existing videos, validates the
edit, and commits. It preserves other locale listings, image types, tracks, and
release notes. A review already in progress blocks the commit instead of being
cancelled. Failed pre-commit edits are abandoned; after a commit or uncertain
network outcome, inspect Play Console and use `verify-play` before retrying.
Never blindly rerun an uncertain commit.

Verification saves public remote state to `tmp/play-release/verification.json`
and compares all 16 locales' copy, image counts, checksums, and ordering. This
proves API parity, not public availability: check Play Console review/publishing
status and sample the localized public listings, including `bg` and `fa`, before
calling the listing live. Read the [Developer API edit lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/edits)
and [commit review behavior](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/edits/commit).

## Measurement

As of the 2026-08-24 baseline, live version `1.20260821.44` was
`READY_FOR_SALE` with only `en-US` and `zh-Hans` metadata. No existing App
Analytics report request was available, so no report was created or committed
during the read-only baseline. After the localized release, record only
thresholded aggregate impressions, product-page views, first-time downloads,
conversion, source type, and territory for a later 28-day comparison. Never
commit user-level analytics or private account data.
