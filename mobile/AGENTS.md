# Beancount Mobile (CE)

React Native iOS/Android app for [Beancount.io](https://beancount.io/), built with Expo (see root `AGENTS.md` for repo-wide rules).

## Tech stack

- **Framework**: React Native 0.86 + Expo 57 + React 19
- **Routing**: Expo Router (file-based, in `app/`)
- **Data**: Apollo Client 3.14 + GraphQL Code Generator
- **State**: Apollo reactive variables (no Redux/Zustand)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Styling**: StyleSheet + custom theme system (light / dark / system)
- **i18n**: `i18n-js` with 13 locales (en, zh, bg, ca, de, es, fa, fr, nl, pt, ru, sk, uk)
- **Errors**: Sentry (`@sentry/react-native`)
- **Analytics**: none — the Mixpanel wrapper was retired (`.pm` `w3/001`); the app ships no event tracking
- **TypeScript**: strict (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `noUnusedLocals`, …); path alias `@/*` → `src/*`

## Verifying in the iOS simulator

UI changes can be driven and screenshotted headlessly — reach for this rather than
asking someone to check by hand. Everything below is plain CLI, so it works the same
for any agent.

**The dev server writes to production.** `.env.local` points `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`
at `https://beancount.io/` and the dev build is signed in, so **any save, edit, delete
or file write commits to a real ledger**. Read-only verification needs no permission;
**ask the user before writing**, and when they agree, delete what you created through
the app afterwards so the ledger is left as found.

```zsh
UDID=$(xcrun simctl list devices booted -j | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(next(d["udid"] for v in json.load(sys.stdin)["devices"].values() for d in v))')
xcrun simctl launch $UDID io.beancount.ios          # the dev build; `expo start --ios` opens Expo Go instead
xcrun simctl openurl $UDID "beancount:///(app)/<route>?param=value"   # params reach useLocalSearchParams
xcrun simctl io $UDID screenshot shot.png           # 1206x2622 on iPhone 17 Pro (3x)
xcrun simctl ui $UDID appearance dark|light         # verify both themes
xcrun simctl spawn $UDID defaults write com.apple.Accessibility ReduceMotionEnabled -int 1
```

**Tapping** uses `expo-mcp` (a devDependency — no MCP session auth needed). Start Metro
with plain `npx expo start`, then spawn
`node node_modules/expo-mcp/bin/expo-mcp.mjs --dev-server-url http://localhost:8081 --root <mobile>`
and speak JSON-RPC over stdin: `initialize` → `notifications/initialized` →
`tools/call`. Tools: `automation_tap` (`{projectRoot, platform:"ios", x, y}` or
`testID`), `automation_take_screenshot`, `automation_find_view`, `collect_app_logs`,
`expo_router_sitemap`. Coordinates are
**logical points** (402x874 on iPhone 17 Pro) — divide screenshot pixels by 3. Each tap
is a real XCUITest event, so it drives native controls that synthetic events can't.

Do **not** set `EXPO_UNSTABLE_MCP_SERVER=1` (2026-08-19): it makes `expo start` dial the
remote MCP tunnel, which times out and kills the dev server — the same `mcp.expo.dev`
breakage that makes the hosted server unusable. The local binary above talks to a plain
dev server and needs no flag. `expo-mcp` has **no text-entry and no scroll tool**.
Typing still works — activate the Simulator and drive the hardware keyboard with
`osascript -e 'tell application "Simulator" to activate' -e 'tell application
"System Events" to keystroke "text"'` (verified 2026-08-27; needs Accessibility
permission for the terminal). Scrolling has no equivalent, so anything below the
fold has to be reached by deep link rather than by swiping.

Notes that keep costing time when forgotten:

- **Haptics cannot be verified here** — a simulator has no Taptic Engine. Cover the
  intent→call mapping with unit tests and hand the feel check to the user.
- **There is no analytics to verify** — the app emits no events at all. Don't add
  a tracking call to "measure" a change; there is no sink, and reviving one is a
  board decision (`.pm` `w3/001`), not a screen-level one.
- **A missing native permission at runtime means a stale dev build**, not a code bug:
  the installed binary predates an `app.json` change. Rebuild the dev client
  (`SENTRY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPLOAD=true npx expo run:ios`) or work around the screen.
- **"Is this pre-existing?"** — stash the working tree (`git stash push -u -- src app`),
  screenshot, then pop. Metro hot-reloads both ways in seconds.
- To catch a sub-second overlay, fire screenshots back-to-back with no sleep (~2/s) and
  diff by file size to find the frames that changed.

## Conventions

### Theme — always use tokens

Theme tokens come from `src/common/theme/`; the provider lives in `src/common/providers/theme-provider/`. Never hard-code colors.

```ts
import { useTheme } from "@/common/theme";
const theme = useTheme().colorTheme;
// theme.white, theme.black, theme.text01, …
```

Test new screens in light **and** dark, and set background colors on loading states — missing those caused dark-mode flicker on the account picker screen.

### Accessibility — label icon-only controls

Every icon-only `Pressable` / `TouchableOpacity` needs `accessibilityRole="button"` and an `accessibilityLabel` (prefer an existing `t("…")` key). Charts need a summarizing `accessibilityLabel` instead of exposing SVG nodes. The guardrail `src/__tests__/accessibility-labels.test.ts` fails the unit suite when a new unlabeled icon-only control appears; add an allowlist entry only with a written reason.

### Loading states — skeleton preloaders, not spinners

Content areas that wait on a query render a skeleton built from `LoadingTile`
(`@/components/loading-tile`), not an `ActivityIndicator` or a blank view:

- The skeleton mirrors the loaded layout: same container, paddings, and dividers.
  Give real text fixed `lineHeight`s and size each tile + its vertical margins to
  fill that same line box, so the view doesn't shift a pixel when data lands
  (see `ListItemSkeleton` in `src/screens/multi-postings-transaction/list-item.tsx`,
  the account-picker loading state, and the suggestions card in
  `src/components/text-input-screen/`).
- Vary tile widths across rows (a const array of widths) so the skeleton reads
  as content, not stripes.
- Skeletons are for first loads only; pull-to-refresh keeps current content
  visible under the `RefreshControl` spinner (`refreshing` must track only the
  user's pull, not query loading).
- Verify skeletons in light **and** dark. `LoadingTile` resolves the effective
  theme via `useTheme()` — never compare `themeVar` to `"dark"` directly, it can
  hold `"system"`.

### Translations — `useTranslations()`, not `i18n.t()` directly

`i18n.t("key")` does not re-render when the locale changes. The hook subscribes to `localeVar`:

```ts
import { useTranslations } from "@/common/hooks/use-translations";
const { t } = useTranslations();
// t("key")
```

When adding a string, add the key to the English file under `src/translations/` (the base). Other locales extend and override as needed.

A count is a plural object, not `Label: {{count}}`. Give each locale exactly the categories `Intl.PluralRules` lists for it: `{ one, other }` in English, `{ one, few, many, other }` in Russian, Ukrainian and Slovak, and `{ other }` alone in Chinese. Then call `t(key, { count })`. `src/common/plural.ts` registers the per-locale rule with i18n-js, and `src/translations/__tests__/plural.test.ts` fails on a missing or extra category.

### Reactive variables for global state

```ts
import { useReactiveVar } from "@apollo/client";
import { themeVar } from "@/common/vars";
const currentTheme = useReactiveVar(themeVar);
```

### Generated GraphQL

`src/generated-graphql/` is produced by `yarn codegen` (config in `codegen.ts`, `apollo.config.json`) and ignored by ESLint. Re-run codegen after schema changes; never hand-edit.

### Screens

Screens live in `src/screens/<name>/` and are mounted from a route file under `app/`. Use `SafeAreaView` for spacing.

Tab screens use `LedgerDrawerHeader` and its `action` descriptor; do not supply
custom header buttons or per-screen height overrides. The header owns equal
side slots, a 50pt default bar with 44pt action targets inside it, and a shared
Dynamic Type height rule, including
read-only and no-action states. Menu triggers share the `iconActionSize` token.
When changing shared header/menu geometry, verify all five tabs (Home,
Transactions, Accounts, Reports, Files), absent/disabled actions, large text,
and both themes. Run the rendered-component contract tests in
`src/components/ledger-drawer/__tests__/header-layout.test.ts`; these inspect
layout props and do not replace native visual verification.

### Home feed releases

`src/screens/home-screen/components/feed-card.tsx` renders the merged `getFeed` result. Rows label their source through `feedSourceLabelKey` in `feed-logic.ts` (`Ledger`, `Blog`, `Release`). There is deliberately no per-user unread state here: the web dashboard tracks its reading position in local storage rather than on the server, so there is nothing for the app to sync with.

`getFeed` accepts the app’s account-wide OAuth credential with `ledger.read` (`USER_SOCIAL_FEED_READ`, backend `authorization-service.ts`). The service checks exact-self access; API keys and credentials pinned to one ledger cannot read this account-wide feed.

## Configuration files

- `app.json` — Expo config; **app version lives here** (and in `package.json`).
- `eas.json` — EAS Build/Submit profiles.
- `apollo.config.json`, `codegen.ts` — GraphQL codegen.
- `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js` — standard.

## App Store metadata (`metadata/`)

Store listing copy is managed as canonical JSON under `metadata/`, applied with the
`asc` CLI (App Store Connect). **`fastlane/` is dead** — nothing reads it, EAS Submit
only uploads the binary via `ascAppId`. Treat `metadata/` as the single source of truth.

```
metadata/
  store-locales.json               runtime/store mapping and bg/fa fallback
  screenshots.json                 locale/device/story/caption manifest
  app-info/<locale>.json          name, subtitle, privacyPolicyUrl
  version-template/<locale>.json  stable copy; whatsNew is always blanked
  version/<version>/<locale>.json description, keywords, promotionalText,
                                  supportUrl, marketingUrl, whatsNew
  screenshots/<locale>/<displayType>/NN-name.png
```

Screenshots are **not** handled by `asc metadata`; they upload separately (see below).
Filename order is display order, and Apple surfaces the first three in search results.

Store localizations: `en-US`, `zh-Hans`, `ca`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `es-MX`,
`fr-FR`, `fr-CA`, `nl-NL`, `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`, `ru`, `sk`, and `uk`. The app also
ships Bulgarian and Persian, but Apple offers no matching metadata locales; both
explicitly inherit primary `en-US` rather than being falsely mapped. Apple's
limits — name 30, subtitle 30, keywords 100, promotional text 170, description
4000 — are counted in **code points**, so CJK characters cost 1 each.

| Command                                                                             | What it does                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn metadata:validate`                                                            | Project checks plus upstream ASC lint                     |
| `asc metadata pull --app 1527950512 --version <v> --dir ./tmp/asc-baseline --force` | Read-only baseline into ignored state                     |
| `./scripts/app-store-release.sh plan <v>`                                           | Metadata plans plus visual screenshot review              |
| `./scripts/app-store-release.sh approve <v> <v>`                                    | Record reviewed local approvals                           |
| `./scripts/app-store-release.sh apply-metadata <v> <v>`                             | Confirmed metadata apply; creates remote locale resources |
| `./scripts/app-store-release.sh plan-screenshots <v>`                               | Read-only replacement/order plan for every screenshot set |
| `./scripts/app-store-release.sh apply-screenshots <v> <v>`                          | Confirmed screenshot apply after final plan review        |

Only **promotional text** is editable while a version is live. `name`, `subtitle`,
`keywords`, `description`, `marketingUrl`, `supportUrl`, and the age-rating
declaration require an editable version, so they ship with a release. The helper
supports `PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION` and withdrawn `DEVELOPER_REJECTED` versions,
with the same review gates for both. Run `yarn bump` locally first; it scaffolds every canonical locale from
`metadata/version-template/` with blank `whatsNew` fields. Fill every localized
release note and stage the listing before the bump reaches `main` and triggers
EAS auto-submit.

### Release-note content

- Write `whatsNew` for users of the target store: describe what they can now do,
  what reads more clearly, or what problem they will no longer encounter. Select
  meaningful changes; do not paste a git log or an internal engineering report.
- Omit dependency/version bumps, refactors, test coverage, CI/build tooling,
  implementation details, and changes with no observable user benefit. When a
  technical fix matters, describe its visible result in plain language.
- Apple release notes must describe only the iPhone/iPad experience. Never copy
  Android fixes or mention Android, Google Play, other mobile platforms, or other
  marketplaces into Apple `whatsNew` (App Review 2.3.10). Keep platform-specific
  release notes separate; review every localization, not only English.
- Review the English notes for relevance and accuracy before translating. Keep
  every translation aligned with the same user-facing changes. Human/agent review
  must check relevance; a keyword guard cannot establish that a claim is useful
  or true.
- Before staging, run `yarn test:unit src/scripts/__tests__` and
  `yarn metadata:validate`. `releaseNoteErrors` rejects known other-platform
  references; the unit suite also validates every current Apple localization.
  After editing already staged metadata, apply and verify it again through the
  release workflow; never hand-update the staging receipt to bypass its digest.

Keywords must not repeat words already in the app name or subtitle — Apple indexes
those separately — and drop the spaces after commas; they count against the 100.

`.asc/` (plan artifacts, and credentials if anyone runs `asc auth login --local`)
is gitignored at the repo root. Keep it that way; this repo is public.

### Screenshots

Apple currently accepts only two display types — everything else is derived from them:

| Display type            | Generated size | Source                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_IPHONE_65`         | 1284×2778      | deterministic public demo captures                    |
| `APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129` | 2064×2752      | deterministic public demo captures on a tablet canvas |

The generated PNGs are gitignored, so rebuild rather than expecting them in a
fresh clone:

```zsh
yarn screenshots:build
yarn screenshots:validate
./scripts/app-store-release.sh plan <version>
```

The build produces 84 opaque Apple assets: 14 locales × two device types × the
three ordered stories in `metadata/screenshots.json`, plus the 64 Play assets
described below. The helper permits Apple uploads against
`PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION` and `DEVELOPER_REJECTED`; all planning, review, replacement, and ordering use
upstream `asc screenshots` commands. See `docs/app-store-localization.md` for the
complete pre-auto-submit choreography.

### Google Play listing

`metadata/store-locales.json` also maps the 13 runtime languages to 16 Play
locales. Play copy is generated into `metadata/play/` from canonical app-info and
version metadata; `metadata/play-source/bg.json` and `fa.json` supply the two
languages Apple cannot offer. Never hand-edit generated Play JSON. Play artwork
uses the same screenshot manifest and demo sources: three 1080×1920 phone images
and one 1024×500 feature graphic per locale, all gitignored. Chromium/headless
shell supplies Persian text shaping (`CHROME_BIN` can select the executable).

Run `yarn play:baseline` with `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` set to a local ignored
JSON key path. Inspect the actual locale coverage in
`tmp/play-baseline/baseline.json` before `yarn play:generate`. Metadata validation
checks Play limits and generated-copy drift; screenshot validation checks both
stores. `./scripts/play-release.sh plan-play` is offline and prints every locale's
diff. After reviewing the text and images within the user's authorization, use
`apply-play <plan-sha256>` and `verify-play`. The helper checks local/remote drift,
validates and commits the edit, and verifies copy and image checksums. It does
not manage tracks or release notes. API parity is not public availability; check
review/publishing state before calling the listing live. See
`docs/app-store-localization.md` for the exact steps.

## Roadmap board (`.pm/`)

File-based product roadmap, managed only through two slash commands:

- `/pm-brainstorm <topic>` — proposes milestones/tasks as text (writes nothing).
- `/pm <subcommand>` — the only writer: materializes workstreams/milestones/tasks, marks done, prints status.

Conventions and pillars live canonically in [`../.agents/skills/pm/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/pm/SKILL.md); anti-goals are in the root [`../.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md`](../.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md). The active adoption board is the root `../.pm/`; `mobile/.pm/` (with its own `GOAL.md` and `DO_NOT_DO.md`) is the app's historical board. Don't edit either by hand outside `/pm`.

## CI / Deploy

- CI (`../.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `yarn format:check`, `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, and `yarn test:unit` on push/PR to `main`. A macOS job validates committed Apple/Play metadata, builds all store artwork, and runs `yarn screenshots:validate` with font-capable ImageMagick and Chromium.
- Release (`../.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, workflow name `Release (mobile)`) runs on every `mobile/**` push to `main` and verifies checks, but deploys only if `package.json`'s version has no `mobile-v<version>` git tag yet. A new version must also carry `metadata/releases/<version>.json`, written by the ASC parity check and bound to the exact listing inputs; a missing or stale receipt blocks EAS before auto-submit. On success it sends the OTA update, runs the EAS builds with auto-submit, and waits until every build finishes and every submission completes; only then does it push the tag and a GitHub Release. The iOS build authenticates to Apple with the App Store Connect API key in the `production` environment secrets (`EXPO_ASC_API_KEY_P8`, `EXPO_ASC_KEY_ID`, `EXPO_ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `EXPO_APPLE_TEAM_ID`); without it a non-interactive build cannot regenerate a provisioning profile and fails whenever `app.json` entitlements outgrow the stored one. A push without a version bump deploys nothing — use `yarn bump` to cut a release; a failed release retries automatically on the next push because the tag is only created after success.
