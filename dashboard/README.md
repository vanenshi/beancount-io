# Beancount Dashboard

## Search Console growth report

The dashboard package includes a read-only Search Console report for URLs owned by the dashboard.
It deliberately excludes CMS, forum, and API paths from its opportunity ranking.

Set GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_B64 in the local .env or CI secret, then run:

    yarn search-console-report --markdown --days 28 --inspect-limit 5

The report covers dashboard paths such as /ledger, /login, /sign-up, /auth, /settings, /lgasset,
and /oauth. It does not treat /forum, /api, or CMS content paths as dashboard opportunities.

Indexability (crawlers): public ledger **read/social** surfaces, user profiles,
the base Ask/agent landing page, and acquisition pages (login, sign-up, forgot
password) are indexable by default. Token/session flows, OTP/welcome, private
settings, parameterized query/error pages, write/editor UIs, bank-link screens,
auth-gated shells, and error pages emit `noindex` via
`src/common/lib/seo/indexability.ts`. Ask deep links with a prefilled question
are noindexed; Ask URLs canonicalize to the base agent page. Following GitHub's
crawl boundary, file directory (`tree`) and write routes stay noindex, while
read-only file (`blob`) pages are indexable with stable canonicals that omit
edit/line query parameters.

Roadmap ideas should go through the repository-level $pm-brainstorm workflow and public .pm board
in the parent repository. Search Console rows are evidence only after route ownership is verified;
do not turn CMS/forum/API rows into dashboard milestones.

The web dashboard for [Beancount.io](https://beancount.io/) — a browser UI for
double-entry bookkeeping: ledgers, reports, journals, an in-app editor, bank
account linking, and an AI assistant.

Part of the [`beancount-io`](https://github.com/bex-co/beancount-io) monorepo.

## Shared entry links

Native **Share link** / **Copy link** on a transaction produce a canonical URL:

`https://beancount.io/ledger/<owner>/<ledger>/entry/<hash>`

Opening that URL in a browser loads the same authorized entry source context
(location + source slice). Public ledgers work anonymously; private ledgers still
require sign-in with pull access. Missing, denied, and network failures stay
distinct. Page metadata describes the destination generically and never embeds
private entry contents. Readers stay read-only; writers keep the same edit/delete
controls as Journal → Entry Context.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22
- Yarn 4 via Corepack (`corepack enable`)
- A running Beancount.io backend (GraphQL API gateway) for `VITE_API_URL` to point at

## Getting started

```zsh
corepack enable
yarn install
cp .env.example .env   # then edit values
yarn dev               # http://localhost:5173
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values. All client-side variables must
be prefixed with `VITE_`.

| Variable                 | Required | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `VITE_API_URL`           | Yes      | Public API Gateway URL used by the browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `VITE_SSR_API_URL`       | No       | Internal API URL for the SSR server. Defaults to `VITE_API_URL`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | No       | GA4 Measurement ID for this environment's analytics data stream. Use a **separate stream per environment** (set the dev/staging stream's ID locally and the production stream's ID in prod). When unset, analytics is disabled and no GA script loads. Non-production builds send events with GA4 `debug_mode` so you can validate instrumentation in GA4 DebugView before it reaches the production stream. |

## Translation performance

The dashboard loads English plus the selected language. Language switches keep
current content visible while loading and offer **Try Again** if a download fails.
After a production build, run `yarn perf:locales` to check locale splitting and the
initial JavaScript budget. See [the measurement guide](./docs/performance-locales.md)
for baseline results and browser verification steps.

## Chart performance

Reports load a smaller chart runtime through a separate client chunk, reserving
chart space while it downloads. See [chart measurements and regression checks](./docs/performance-charts.md)
for the registry inventory, production comparison, and reproduction steps.

## Route loading

Ledger routes wait for the ledger and the page's primary report. An authorized
public overview also attempts to include `README.md` in its initial HTML, with a
one-second file-read deadline. Private README files, sidebar directive counts,
and account metadata remain deferred; client navigation does not wait for the
README. Missing files render no card, while failed or timed-out server reads can
recover in the browser. See
[route loading measurements](./docs/performance-route-loading.md) for the
delay-injection traces, request accounting, and reproduction steps.

## Public ledger presentation

Public readers can open the [stock example](https://beancount.io/ledger/open_ledger/stock-example)
without signing in. The overview uses the ledger's `option "title"`, falling back
to its name, and introduces the ledger using its description or the first README
paragraph. With no saved layout, ledger notes precede reports; jump links reach
either section. Saved layouts and owners' defaults remain available. Unfiltered
money movement initially selects the latest month with income or expense
activity; explicit periods and user selections remain authoritative.

The router owns ledger titles, descriptions, canonical links and social metadata
through `src/common/lib/seo/ledger-head.ts`. The public overview shares its title
and introduction policy with the visible page. Private and editor routes retain
their noindex policy. Social previews use the owned 256×256 logo with a small
summary card. Public URL discovery is covered by the backend's
[sitemap contract](../backend-cluster/backend-v2/docs/sitemap.md).

## Personal access tokens

Signed-in paid-plan users can create scoped API credentials from **Settings →
Personal access tokens**, or open
[`/settings/api-keys`](https://beancount.io/settings/api-keys) directly. The
creation flow defaults to read-only access, supports an optional single-ledger
restriction and expiry, and reveals the plaintext only once. Existing tokens
show lifecycle metadata and a display prefix, never the recoverable secret.

## OAuth consent pages

The dashboard serves the human interaction pages for backend-v2's authorization
server. `/oauth/mobile-consent` reuses the normal login, registration, and OTP
forms, then shows an account-wide native-app approval; it never posts a bearer
token to a WebView. The backend issuer redirects here through backend-v2's
`DASHBOARD_URL`, which must resolve to the same hostname as the issuer —
backend-v2 refuses to start otherwise, because the interaction cookie the
authorization server sets would not be readable from a different host. Keep the
dashboard and issuer behind one HTTPS front door in production; the documented
loopback stack is the development exception, where both sides are `localhost`
on different ports and cookies are shared regardless of port.

The older login/signup `postMessage` bridge remains solely for already-released
mobile versions. It emits a bounded, token-free
`legacy_mobile_auth_completed` retirement signal only when the React Native
WebView object is present. See the mobile README for the minimum-version and
30-day-zero-use removal gate.

## Exporting financial statements

Open a ledger's Balance Sheet, Income Statement, or Cash Flow report, apply
the time, account,
advanced, interval, and conversion controls you need, then choose **Export**
in the report header. **Spreadsheet CSV** downloads the visible filtered
hierarchy in a formula-safe, Excel-compatible file, including both source-ledger
and statement-facing signs. **Markdown report** downloads a reviewable,
pagination-independent management statement with consistent amount formatting.
Income Statement exports put the conventional single-step summary first—total
revenue, total expenses, and net income or loss—and move the complete account
hierarchy into a supporting-detail appendix. Multi-unit results are explicitly
labeled as a management schedule and must not be added across units; select a
presentation currency for a single-currency statement.
Cash Flow exports open with net cash from operating, investing, and financing
activities, then the opening → net change → closing cash bottom line, with
per-activity account detail as supporting sections. Accounts default to a
heuristic activity split and cash & equivalents set inferred from account
names; an account can declare its role explicitly via `cash-flow-role`
metadata on its `open` directive (see `../docs/adrs/ADR003-dashboard-cash-flow-ledger-roles.md`),
and cash-flow exports disclose the inference only for rows still resolved by
the heuristic.
Balance Sheet exports similarly put an accounting-equation summary first—total
assets, total liabilities, total equity, total liabilities and equity, and the
reconciliation difference—then move the complete ledger hierarchy to a new-page
supporting appendix with section totals at the bottom. A nonzero reconciliation
difference keeps the statement labeled as an internal draft. Because the source
hierarchy does not carry maturity classifications, the export discloses that
current and non-current groupings are unavailable instead of guessing from
account names.
**Print / Save as PDF** opens the browser's print dialog with an unaudited
management statement, reporting dates, scope notices, and ledger-unit
disclosures; choose your browser's PDF destination to create a PDF. The
reporting entity is taken from Beancount's `option "title"`; if it is missing,
the export uses the source ledger name and displays a readiness notice. Other
report pages do not expose this statement export menu.
