# Beancount Dashboard

React 19 web client built with TanStack Start/Router, Apollo Client, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix primitives, and Vitest. Code is organized by feature rather than file type.

## Layout

```

More specific guidance cascades from:

- `src/features/importer/AGENTS.md`
- `src/features/ledger-data/AGENTS.md`
- `src/features/reports/AGENTS.md`

Commit history file links use `#diff-file-<encoded-path>` fragments. The shared
`common/components/diff-viewer` honors those after the diff is ready — including
virtualized lists via `scrollToRow` and the explicit Load Large Diff gate — so
reopened URLs and Files → Version History selections land on the requested file.

## Organization rules

- New product behavior belongs in `src/features/<feature>/`. Keep pages, components, hooks, GraphQL operations, types, utilities, tests, and translations with the feature that owns them.
- Route files under `src/routes/` should stay thin and import the feature page or loader.
- Cross-feature infrastructure belongs in `src/common/`; do not make one feature import another feature's private component or utility just for convenience.
- Shared Radix-based primitives live in `src/common/components/ui/`. Feature-specific components stay in their feature.
- Use the `@/` alias for `src/` imports. Prefer direct module imports; a barrel is optional and should not create cycles.
- Test files live in adjacent `__tests__/` directories and match the behavior they cover.

A typical feature uses only the folders it needs:

```
features/<name>/
├── pages/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── lib/ or utils/
├── graphql/
├── types/
├── locales/
└── __tests__/ (or tests adjacent to the owning folder)
```

## Development

Run from `dashboard/`. This package uses Yarn 4.17.0.

```zsh
yarn install --immutable
yarn dev
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
yarn lint:deadcode
yarn lint:deadcode:fix
yarn test
yarn build
yarn format:check
yarn codegen
```

- `yarn lint` runs route generation, TypeScript, ESLint, and Knip dead-code detection.
- `yarn lint:deadcode:fix` removes unused files, exports, and exported types; review its diff before keeping the changes.
- `yarn typecheck` generates routes before `tsc -b`.
- `yarn test` is the non-watch Vitest suite; `yarn test:watch` and `yarn test:coverage` are available locally.
- The handoff/CI gate is `yarn format:check && yarn lint && yarn test && yarn build`.
- `yarn codegen` owns generated GraphQL types. Do not hand-edit generated output.

## Internationalization

The dashboard supports 15 languages: en, bg, ca, de, es, fa, fr, ja, ko, nl, pt, ru, sk, uk, and zh.

- Feature translations live in `src/features/<feature>/locales/`.
- `src/i18n/locales/` aggregates feature locale modules; `src/i18n/config.ts` is the canonical supported-language list.
- Use `useTranslations()` from `@/common/hooks/use-translations`; do not import the i18next singleton into reactive components.
- Add every new key to the English feature locale, then add matching keys to the other locale files. `src/test/translations.test.ts` checks locale shape.
- Keep keys feature-namespaced (for example `auth.login`) and use i18next interpolation syntax.
- Counts are plural messages, not `Label: {count}` workarounds. Write one form per category the language uses (`{ one, other }` in English; `{ one, few, many, other }` in Russian, Ukrainian and Slovak; `{ other }` only in Chinese, Japanese and Korean), and call `t(key, { count })`. `src/i18n/plural.ts` expands the forms into i18next's `_one`/`_few`/… keys, and `src/i18n/__tests__/plural.test.ts` fails when a language's forms differ from `Intl.PluralRules`.

## Environment variables

Prefer runtime logic or typed configuration in `src/config/`. Add a Vite environment variable only for a value that must vary by build/deployment; all client-prefixed values are public.

Current variables:

| Variable                 | Required | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_URL`           | Yes      | Public GraphQL/API gateway URL used by the browser.                                         |
| `VITE_SSR_API_URL`       | No       | Internal URL for SSR; falls back to `VITE_API_URL`.                                         |
| `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | No       | Per-environment GA4 stream; unset disables analytics. Non-production builds use debug mode. |

When adding one, update `src/vite-env.d.ts`, the typed config, `.env.example`, `README.md`, and any applicable deployment definitions (`../deploy/docker-mac/` and root `bex.yaml`). Never put a secret in a `VITE_*` variable.

## Growth planning and Search Console

The public adoption roadmap is the repository-root `.pm/` board. Use the root `/pm-brainstorm` workflow to propose work; `/pm` is the only writer.

For Search Console evidence, run `yarn search-console-report --markdown --days 28`. It uses the fixed `https://beancount.io/` property and ranks only dashboard-owned paths: `/ledger`, `/login`, `/sign-up`, `/auth`, `/settings`, `/lgasset`, and `/oauth`. Rows that differ only by query parameters are grouped under their canonical page (query and hash stripped), with clicks and impressions summed, position impression-weighted, and a variant count. The same host fronts CMS, forum, and API services, so do not treat `/forum/**`, `/api/**`, `/.well-known`, or CMS content as dashboard opportunities. Confirm route ownership and never put credentials or report user data on the public board.

## Code standards

- Use plain function components, not the `FC` type.
- Keep server-only configuration and calls out of browser bundles. Use the established `*.server.ts`/server-function boundaries.
- Reuse common responsive and accessibility primitives before adding another abstraction.
- Charts use ECharts 6; keep report-specific transformation close to its feature and test transformations independently from rendering.

## Dashboard home (`/ledger`)

`src/features/ledger-list/pages/dashboard-page/` composes two sections, each backed by one `source` of the `getFeed` operation:

- **What's new** (`components/whats-new.tsx`, `source: "CHANGELOG"`): the localized changelog RSS, newest first. Rows are Beancount-style lines (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `!` unread / `*` read, title). The block is expanded with an accent edge while anything is unread, one collapsed line once everything is read, and absent when the request fails or is empty. It renders **every release the hook counts** — capping the rows below the count once left "N updates" on screen with no unread row left to open. Read state is keyed on a locale-independent release identity, because item ids and links carry the locale that fetched them and a language switch would otherwise make an opened release unread again. The unread watermark lives in `src/common/hooks/use-changelog-watermark.ts` and is **per device, in local storage only**: a reading position is not a fact the server acts on, so it does not earn a column on the identity table or a public mutation. A 30-day cutoff covers a first visit and is **recorded once** rather than recomputed against the current clock, so an unread release cannot quietly age out of the window. The watermark advances only on an explicit action — "Mark all as read" or opening the last unread row. Neither visiting a page nor the passage of time marks a release as seen. Both feed queries use `cache-and-network`, so returning to the dashboard revalidates instead of replaying a cache that predates the newest release or the user's own last commit. Titles and links arrive already translated from the CMS; only chrome strings are dashboard translations (`common.whatsNew*`).
- **Activity** (`components/activity-feed.tsx`, `source: "LEDGER_RSS"`): the user's own ledger commits with "Show More" paging.

Two deliberate absences. The blog is **not** on the dashboard: it publishes roughly twenty posts a day and none of them carry a `beancount` tag, so it is search inventory rather than something a signed-in customer needs, and no amount of collapsing earned it the space. There is also no header entry point on ledger pages: an icon-only control with an unread dot was built and judged not worth the header space.

## Shell accessibility

The ledger shell (`src/common/components/ledger-layout/`) and the `/ledger` dashboard shell (`src/features/ledger-list/pages/dashboard-page/components/dashboard-layout.tsx`) share the same accessibility structure:

- Each primary sidebar composes `SidebarNavigation` (a labelled `<nav>` landmark). Do **not** put the landmark inside the shared `sidebar.tsx` primitive — only navigation regions should expose one.
- Both shells render `SkipToContentLink` as the first focusable element and give `<main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1}>` so keyboard users can skip past the sidebar. Reuse `src/common/components/skip-to-content.tsx` and `src/common/lib/main-content.ts` for any future sidebar shell.

Entry Context (`features/journal/components/entry-context-dialog.tsx`) restores focus to the originating journal/overview control on dismiss via `restoreFocusOnDialogClose`, with a caller fallback when the opener is removed after a successful edit. Source-file navigation skips that restore so focus is not pulled back to the list.
