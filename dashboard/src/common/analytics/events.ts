/**
 * Event taxonomy — the single source of truth for product analytics events.
 *
 * Adding/changing an event means editing the `AnalyticsEvents` registry below.
 * Because `track()` is typed against this registry, event names and their
 * parameters are enforced at compile time, which prevents the taxonomy drift
 * that arises from calling the raw `trackEvent(name, params)` with free-form
 * strings.
 *
 * CURRENT FOCUS (v1): registration (`sign_up`), login (`login`), and page views.
 * route_view is NOT in this registry — it is a custom page-navigation event
 * owned by AnalyticsProvider (see analytics-provider.tsx + track.ts) that fires
 * alongside GA4's auto page_view with fully normalized, PII-free parameters.
 *
 * Conventions (see docs/event-taxonomy.md for the full spec):
 *  - snake_case, object_action, past tense for completed actions.
 *  - Reuse GA4 recommended names (sign_up, login, …) where they map cleanly so
 *    GA4's built-in reporting and predictive audiences light up.
 *  - Never send raw ledger/account names, per-user ids, or monetary amounts —
 *    prefer bucketed/derived attributes.
