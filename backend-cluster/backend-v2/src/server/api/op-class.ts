 *   `ledger.admin`. `admin` is the ledger's own control plane: its existence,
 *   its collaborators, its keys, its bank bindings — and the reads of those,
 *   because an access-control list is not ledger content.
 * - `session-only` is the honest name for an op no scope alone can unlock. The
 *   vocabulary is deliberately three ledger scopes wide, so billing and the
 *   remaining browser-only identity ceremonies have no scope that describes
 *   them.
 *   Filing them under `admin` would mean a token granted "manage my ledger"
 *   could also delete the account — so they get a class that never matches.
 * - `public` is for the handful of ops that carry no authority at all (a
 *   liveness probe, the feature-flag bootstrap). It exists so "needs nothing"
 *   is stated rather than approximated by `read`.
 *
 * An op absent from the table is treated as `write`, not as an error — see
 * {@link classifyOp}. That is the fail-closed default; the coverage test
 * (`op-class-coverage.test.ts`) is what keeps it from ever firing in
 * production.
