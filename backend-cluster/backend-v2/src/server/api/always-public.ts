/**
 * The census of REST mounts that sit outside the scope gate (ADR 0006 D9,
 * test 3).
 *
 * Every entry answers one question — *why is this reachable without a scoped
 * credential?* — and `__tests__/always-public.test.ts` compares this list
 * against what the composition root actually mounted, in both directions. A new
 * ungated route cannot ship until someone writes down why, and a route that
 * moves under the gate cannot leave a stale excuse behind.
 *
 * "Outside the gate" is not the same as "unauthenticated". Several of these
 * carry a credential the scope vocabulary cannot describe — a webhook
 * signature, an `x-api-key`, an admin token, git's own basic auth — and two of
 * them are surface transports whose ops are gated one level in, per field and
 * per tool. Each says which.
