/**
 * ADR 0006 D9, test 2 — the op-class table matches what the process serves, in
 * both directions.
 *
 * This is the mechanism that keeps the fail-closed default from ever firing in
 * production. An unclassified op is treated as `write` at runtime, which is the
 * safe answer but the wrong one; the point is that it never gets that far,
 * because shipping an op nobody classified turns CI red first. The reverse
 * direction matters just as much: a stale row keeps its class alive for an op
 * that no longer exists, which is how a table stops describing anything.
