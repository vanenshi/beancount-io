 * the root — which is what keeps the graph acyclic and lets the guard tests in
 * `__tests__/` introspect the whole API without booting it.
 *
 * Before this existed, the three were assembled in three unrelated places: a
 * per-feature call list for REST, a separate Apollo bootstrap for GraphQL, and
 * an `McpServer` constructed inline inside the MCP route handler. Nothing could
 * answer "every op this process serves", so nothing could check the three
