 * to `undefined`. Registering the union directly is therefore strictly worse
 * than registering nothing: `tools/list` advertises no schema *and* every call

 * the output validator dereferences what the normalizer declined to produce.
 * Verified against `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.0 (ADR 0007 D8).
 *
 * So the discriminant is widened to a plain `ok: boolean` and both payload
 * members become optional. Note what does and does not change: the **payload**
 * is untouched — a result still arrives as `{ ok: true, result }` or
 * `{ ok: false, error }`, and `runToolSafely` still produces exactly those.
 * Only the published *description* loosens, trading the union's "ok: true
 * implies result" for a schema that exists at all. The descriptions below carry
