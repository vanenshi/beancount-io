/**
 * ADR 0006 D4/D9: MCP used to authorize once, at connect, for the whole
 * session — a collaborator removed mid-session kept working until the
 * client reconnected. w1/m19 deleted that check; authorization now happens
 * inside the ledger service on every tool call (mcp-route.ts's
 * `resolveMcpLedgerId` no longer touches the database at all).
 *
 * This test proves the property that removal was FOR: revoking access
 * between two tool calls in the same MCP conversation is honored by the very
 * next call, not merely at the next session. It exercises the real
 * `LedgerShellService` + `authorizeLedger` seam (not a mock of the seam
 * itself, which would just prove the mock behaves as configured) — only the
 * database/Fava boundary is faked, and that fake is what "revokes" access
 * between the two calls.
