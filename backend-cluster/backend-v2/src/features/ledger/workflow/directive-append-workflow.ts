/**
 * Appending Beancount text, coordinated over the repository service (w2/012).
 *
 * This lived inside `LedgerEntryService`'s writer, driving the raw Fava client
 * to read files, bean-check a projection, and commit — a second write path
 * into the repository that the repo service's guards did not cover. The gap
 * that mattered: `assertSafeRepoPath` ran only on a caller-supplied `path`, so
 * a target produced by the ledger's own routing rules reached the commit
 * unasserted.
 *
 * It moved here rather than into the service because it is multi-step
 * coordination — parse, route, read, project, check, commit — which is what
 * `workflow/` is for. The steps that touch the repository now go through
 * `ILedgerRepoService`, so every path is asserted per operation and the dry
 * run refuses exactly what the commit would, by construction rather than by
 * two implementations agreeing.
 *
 * The reason this was deferred out of m28 — that `LEDGER_FILES_WRITE` would
 * narrow the credential ceiling alongside `LEDGER_ENTRIES_WRITE` — turned out
 * not to hold: the two actions declare the same relationship
 * (`ledger` → `write_contents`), the same credential requirement, and the same
 * audit class, so the ceiling is identical and only the audit trail gains a
 * row. That row is honest — this operation does write files.
