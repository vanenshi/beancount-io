# Beancount.io MCP guide

Beancount.io exposes a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets an
agent query a ledger, read and edit its files, fetch reports, and work with linked
banks. It runs inside `backend-v2` at **`/api-gateway/mcp`**. The agent connects to
a Beancount.io deployment; this endpoint does not open a local `.bean` file on
the agent's machine.

This guide describes the implementation in this repository, reviewed on
2026-09-16. It explains the surface rather than counting it: `tools/list` and
`resources/templates/list` are the inventory, and they are what your deployment
actually serves. A number written down here only says when someone last looked.
This document is not a production availability check.

## Connect a client

Use a client that supports **Streamable HTTP**. For a deployment at
`https://books.example.com`, the endpoint is:

```text
https://books.example.com/api-gateway/mcp
```

The shorter `/mcp` path is not registered by the backend. Choose one of the two
credential flows below. A credential may be pinned to a single ledger,
identified as `owner/name` (for example `alice/books`), or left unpinned;
an unpinned credential selects its ledger per call with `ledger: "owner/name"`
on tools and with the `{owner}/{name}` components of resource URIs.

### Personal API key

1. Sign in to your deployment and open `/settings/api-keys` (Personal access
   tokens). Creating a key requires a paid plan.
2. Give the key a name, select `ledger.read` to start with queries and reports,
   and optionally fill **Ledger restriction (optional)** with `alice/books`.
   A pinned key defaults every call to that ledger and cannot widen past it; an
   unpinned key works too, but must then select `ledger: "owner/name"` on each
   ledger tool call and name the ledger in resource URIs.
3. Copy the plaintext key when it is shown. Only its digest and display prefix
   are stored, so the plaintext cannot be retrieved later.
4. Add the endpoint and bearer header to your MCP client's private configuration.

For clients accepting the `mcpServers` JSON format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beancount": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://books.example.com/api-gateway/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer bcio_replace_with_your_ledger_scoped_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Configuration syntax varies by client; the URL, transport, and HTTP header are
the parts to preserve. Keep the real key out of committed configuration files.

An API key can also be created through `POST /api-gateway/v1/api-keys` using an
authorized browser session or an API-audience OAuth credential with admin
capability. The request body includes `name`, `scopes`, and
`ledgerScope: "alice/books"`; `expiresAt` is optional. See the
[key schemas](../src/features/apikeys/api/api-key-schemas.ts). An API key cannot
create another API key, including through MCP's `manageApiKeys` tool.

### OAuth

For clients supporting OAuth discovery and dynamic client registration, configure
the same MCP URL and start the client's authorization flow:

1. An unauthenticated MCP request receives `401` and a `WWW-Authenticate` header
   pointing to `{issuer}/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.
2. That document identifies the MCP resource and authorization server. The
   client discovers the authorization, registration, and token endpoints.
3. The client registers, then requests scopes in authorization code flow with
   PKCE. In the browser, sign in and review the requested permissions on
   `/oauth/consent`. Select one ledger or explicitly choose **All accessible
   ledgers**, then approve. The client chooses the requested scopes; the page
   displays them and lets you approve or cancel.
4. The client exchanges the code and sends the access token as a bearer on
   subsequent MCP requests. Clients requesting `offline_access` can use refresh
   tokens to obtain new access tokens.

This discovery sequence follows the
[MCP authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization).
Beancount's provider implements it in
[`oidc-route.ts`](../src/features/oauth/api/oidc-route.ts).

The OAuth resource/audience must be **`{issuer}/api-gateway/mcp`**, and a ledger-restricted token
carries its selected `ledger_id`. Application API/mobile tokens targeting
`{issuer}/v1` do not authenticate to MCP. A browser session token or cookie also
does not authenticate to MCP, even though a browser session is used to approve
the OAuth grant.

### From the MCP Registry

Beancount.io publishes the hosted endpoint to the official MCP Registry
(`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) as **`io.beancount/beancount`** (see
[Publishing the registry listing](#publishing-the-registry-listing)). Clients,
subregistries, and aggregators that read the registry — Smithery and PulseMCP
are among those the registry's own documentation names — install it from there
on their own schedule. The entry names `https://beancount.io/api-gateway/mcp` and nothing else:
no header and no package, so a client that installs it meets the same `401` and
discovery chain as one configured by hand, and signs in with the OAuth flow
above. Claude Code and Codex do not browse the registry; configure them with the
URL as described earlier in this section.

A self-hosted deployment is not in the listing; configure its URL by hand.

To inspect the published entry:

```bash
curl -fsS "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers/io.beancount%2Fbeancount/versions/latest" \
  | jq '{_meta, server: (.server | {name, version, remotes})}'
```

## Permissions and ledger boundaries

The current implementation computes cumulative capabilities from the grant:

| Scope          | Capability                                                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ledger.read`  | Query and read ledger content.                                                            |
| `ledger.write` | Read plus ordinary writes, including file edits and bank imports.                         |
| `ledger.admin` | Read, write, and administrative operations, including key and bank-connection management. |

These are credential ceilings. The protected service also checks the caller's
current relationship to the ledger or other target. Bank access, for example,
requires the ledger's administrator relationship even for bank reads. Possessing
a scope does not grant ownership or collaborator access. The capability rules
live in [`identity.ts`](../src/server/api/identity.ts); final decisions live in
the [authorization service](../src/server/api/authorization/authorization-service.ts).

Ledger tools accept an optional `ledger` argument (`owner/name`). A pinned
credential defaults to its pin and cannot select another ledger. An unpinned
credential must select a ledger explicitly. Resource URIs select the ledger
with `owner/name` under the same restriction. Account tools need no ledger.
The OAuth consent page offers a single-ledger restriction or explicit account-wide
access, including ledgers accessible in the future and account operations allowed
by the requested scopes. Neither choice is selected automatically. Account-wide
approval works before creating a ledger; choosing to create the first ledger
returns to the same interaction. The backend rejects an omitted choice or a
combined ledger pin and account-wide choice. Refresh preserves the chosen
restriction and the MCP audience.

The registry lists all tools regardless of the caller's permissions; discovery
is not proof that a call is authorized. Identity is resolved for each HTTP
request, and protected services authorize each operation. Revoked API keys and
removed ledger access are checked on subsequent requests. OAuth access tokens
are validated as signed JWTs; revoking a refresh token does not immediately
invalidate an already issued access token. Access tokens normally last one hour.

## How a request reaches the ledger

```text
MCP client
  -> POST /api-gateway/mcp
  -> resolveIdentity (optional ledger pin)
  -> per-request McpServer and StreamableHTTPServerTransport
  -> registered tool or resource handler
  -> rate limiter + operation classification
  -> protected application service + authorization decision
  -> ledger service / repository / bank provider
  -> MCP result
```

[`mcp-route.ts`](../src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-route.ts) builds the request's
`ToolContext` with its identity, ledger ID, and application services. The
[composition root](../src/server/api/composition-root.ts) registers the tools and
resources from feature descriptors and wraps their handlers with the common
operation gate.

For example, `runBqlQuery` calls `LedgerShellService.queryShellText`, which
authorizes the caller and delegates through the ledger API client.
`readLedgerFiles` and `editLedgerFiles` use `LedgerRepoService`. GraphQL and REST
use these same services. MCP is an adapter to those capabilities; the client's
agent decides which calls to make.

Each request gets a fresh server and transport, with
`sessionIdGenerator: undefined`, and the server is closed after handling it.
There is no persistent MCP session ID, standalone GET stream, or resource
subscription channel. Authenticated `GET` and `DELETE` requests
return `405` with `Allow: POST`. POST responses can still use SSE framing.
This is compatible with the optional GET stream in the
[Streamable HTTP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports).

## Tools

Call `tools/list` for the deployed input and output schemas. Arguments below are
the principal inputs; inspect the schema before constructing a call.

| Tool                    | Inputs and behavior                                                                                                                                                       | Capability |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `runBqlQuery`           | `{ "query": "BALANCES" }`; returns formatted query output as a string.                                                                                                    | Read       |
| `runBqlQueryStructured` | `{ "query": "BALANCES" }`; returns typed column metadata and rows, or a structured text result, matching REST JSON and GraphQL `queryShell`.                              | Read       |
| `listLedgers`           | Optional `page`, `limit` (at most 100); omit both for every ledger. A pinned credential returns its one ledger. Start here, then `getLedgerContext`.                      | Read       |
| `checkLedger`           | `{}`; bean-check errors with file and line, entry counts, and the latest commit, in one call. Call after any write.                                                       | Read       |
| `getLedgerContext`      | Optional `payeeLimit`; attributes, open accounts, currencies, payees, years, and source files with counts.                                                                | Read       |
| `getEntryContext`       | `entryHash`; the source context around one entry — read before editing it.                                                                                                | Read       |
| `listLedgerFiles`       | Optional `dir_path`; lists one directory level, directories first.                                                                                                        | Read       |
| `readLedgerFiles`       | `files: [{ path, start_line?, end_line? }]`; returns text and line-range metadata.                                                                                        | Read       |
| `appendLedgerText`      | `text`, optional `path`, `dry_run`, `allowInvalid`; appends Beancount directive text, routed by type and date and inserted in date order.                                 | Write      |
| `refreshManagedPrices`  | Optional `ledger`; re-fetches every managed price include (`include "https://beancount.io/prices/BTC-USD"`) now and returns each source's status. Never edits the ledger. | Write      |
| `editLedgerFiles`       | `description`, `files`, optional `dry_run`; batches create/update/replace/delete operations into one commit.                                                              | Write      |
| `manageApiKeys`         | `operation: list / create / revoke`, operation-specific arguments. `create` returns plaintext once; requires OAuth on MCP and a paid plan.                                | Admin      |
| `manageBankImport`      | `operation: sync / submit / discard`, operation-specific arguments, optional `dry_run`.                                                                                   | Write      |
| `manageBankConnection`  | `operation: reconcile / map_account / set_currency / refresh / unlink`, operation-specific arguments.                                                                     | Admin      |

The implementation is listed in
[`mcp-tools.ts`](../src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-tools.ts).
MCP key creation advertises camelCase `ledgerScope` and ISO 8601 `expiresAt`
(`format: date-time`). The snake_case spellings stay accepted on input for one
release; when both spellings arrive, the documented one wins.
An omitted or blank ledger restriction inherits the caller's pin; an omitted
expiry creates a key without an expiry. A new key cannot exceed its creator's
scopes or widen its ledger restriction. MCP key results use
`key_prefix`, `ledger_scope`, `last_used_at`, `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, and
`created_at` for REST/GraphQL's camelCase fields; `revoked` remains available
for compatibility. Only creation returns the plaintext key.

### Writing directives as Beancount text

`appendLedgerText` takes the text you would write into a file:

```json
{
  "text": "2026-01-02 * \"Cafe\" \"Coffee\"\n  Expenses:Food   4.50 USD\n  Assets:Cash    -4.50 USD"
}
```

It parses the text into directives and refuses anything that is not one —
prose, a diff, JSON — before writing. Each directive goes to the file the
ledger's own `bcio` options assign its type and date, unless `path` names one,
and is inserted after the last directive dated on or before it rather than at
the end of the file. A file whose own directives are out of date order gets
them appended, and says so in `appendedUnsorted`.

Before committing, it bean-checks the projected ledger. New errors are a
refusal — `UNBALANCED` when a transaction does not balance — unless
`allowInvalid` records them deliberately. `dry_run` returns the unified diff
and the projected errors without committing. At most 50 directives per call.

Prefer it over `editLedgerFiles` for adding directives: `editLedgerFiles`
replaces file contents, so appending with it means reading, concatenating, and
writing the whole file back — which is how entries end up at the bottom of
`main.bean` out of order. Use `editLedgerFiles` to restructure files and
`editEntrySource` to change a directive that already exists.

### Reading and editing files

Paths are relative to the ledger repository. Use `listLedgerFiles` to discover
them. Line ranges in `readLedgerFiles` are 1-based and inclusive; the response
contains `startLine`, `endLine`, `totalLines`, and raw `content`. It does not
prefix every line of the content with a line number.

File-edit operations have these shapes:

| Operation | Required fields besides `operation` and `path`                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`  | `content`: new file text.                                                    |
| `update`  | `old_string`, `new_string`: exact replacement; the old text must occur once. |
| `replace` | `content`: complete replacement text.                                        |
| `delete`  | None.                                                                        |

Send plain UTF-8 text, not base64. For example, these are arguments to
`editLedgerFiles` for a preview; use an existing path and exact text from your
own ledger:

```json
{
  "description": "Correct a transaction narration",
  "dry_run": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "operation": "update",
      "path": "main.bean",
      "old_string": "\"Grocery shooping\"",
      "new_string": "\"Grocery shopping\""
    }
  ]
}
```

`dry_run` defaults to `false`. With `true`, the tool reads existing files as
needed, checks replacement matches, constructs operations, and runs the same
write authorization and repository-path validation as the commit — a caller
the commit would refuse is refused by the preview too. The preview returns the
operation `count` and paths plus a unified `diff` per touched file and
bean-check's verdict over the projected content (`validation` with
`errorsBefore`, `errorsAfter`, and `newErrors`), so review the diff and the
new errors before re-issuing the same call with `dry_run: false`. It does
**not** exercise the final repository commit, so a successful preview still
does not guarantee that applying the edit will succeed.

Applying the edit calls `LedgerRepoService.changeFiles` and creates an atomic
commit with message `AI edit: {description}`. Existing-file operations include
the fetched file SHA. The MCP handler does not present an approval dialog;
confirmation behavior belongs to the client. These details come from the
[file-edit implementation](../src/features/ai-agent/tools/edit-ledger-files-tool.ts).

### Bank import workflow

Link a new bank in the browser first; MCP has no tool for the bank-link widget.
The connection/account metadata reads below require `ledger.admin`. A
`ledger.write` credential can perform the import steps when the needed IDs and
mappings are already known. Both still require the current bank relationships.
After linking:

1. Read the `banks` and `bank-accounts` resources to find connection IDs and
   ledger-account mappings.
2. Call `manageBankImport` with `operation: "sync"` and `item_id` to pull bank
   transactions into staging.
3. Read `bank-transactions/unsynced` (optionally `?accountId=...` to select one
   bank account). Select the transactions and accounts to
   book; the suggestion resources can help categorize them.
4. Call `manageBankImport` with `operation: "submit"` and
   `transactions: [{ transaction_id, target_account, source_account? }]`.
   Optional `filename` selects an existing ledger file.
5. Use `operation: "discard"` with `transaction_ids` to remove unwanted staged
   transactions.

`sync`, `submit`, and `discard` accept `dry_run: true` to invoke their service
preview paths. Bank-connection `reconcile` and `unlink` also accept previews.
`map_account`, `set_currency`, and `refresh` have no preview contract and reject
`dry_run: true` before invoking a bank service. Omit the flag or set it to false
to apply these operations immediately.
Inspect the [bank tool dispatcher](../src/features/ai-agent/tools/bank-import-tool.ts)
for the arguments each operation requires.

### Asset and archive URL discovery

`beancount://assets/download-url{?ledgerRepoId,filename}` returns
`{ "downloadUrl": "..." }` for a repository asset. Both arguments are required;
`ledgerRepoId` is the positive numeric repository ID, and `filename` is a path
relative to its asset directory. The service resolves the ledger, enforces the
credential pin and file-read permission, and signs the URL. REST exposes this
at `GET /api-gateway/v1/asset-download-url` with the same query arguments.

`beancount://{owner}/{name}/archive-download-url` returns the existing HTTP URL
for `main.zip`. Fetch that URL using the same session cookie, OAuth bearer
token, or API key. Every archive fetch checks access again and returns a
`private, no-store` response. Credentials are never embedded in archive URLs.

Asset URLs use object-storage signatures and their configured expiry. Previously
issued asset URLs remain usable until that expiry; relationship revocation
prevents issuing new URLs. Archive URLs instead require current authorization
at download time. These resources discover URLs.

For direct archive delivery, read
`beancount://{owner}/{name}/archive/{archive}`. It returns an MCP resource
`blob` containing base64-encoded archive bytes, with the upstream `mimeType`.
The original Content-Disposition value is retained in
`_meta["beancount/contentDisposition"]`. Decode `blob` to save the archive.

MCP and both REST spellings share the existing 30-downloads-per-minute
credential bucket. Every download checks current ledger access. REST
streams the response; MCP buffers it to produce a base64 resource payload.
GraphQL's deliberate raw-byte exclusion remains unchanged.

### Pull requests

Read `beancount://{owner}/{name}/pull-request{?prNumber}` to inspect metadata,
file statistics, and the full diff. This requires repository read authority.

`managePullRequests` requires repository write authority and a `ledger` target
(`owner/name`), which may be omitted for a pinned credential:

- `create` requires `title`, `description`, `clearCommitMessage`, and
  `changes: [{ "path": "...", "content": "..." }]`. Each content value is the
  complete replacement file text; empty title/description and a missing commit
  message are refused. `baseBranch` defaults to `main` — say so when the
  target is not `main`. Before opening the PR the service verifies the branch
  differs from base and refuses a diff-less branch unless `fastForward: true`
  skips verification. The result carries the PR's actual `baseBranch`/`headBranch`
  refs — use those to follow up, not the requested names.
- `approve` requires `prNumber` and merges the PR.
- `reject` requires `prNumber` and closes it without merging.

Reviews apply immediately; preview is unsupported. Domain failures return
`success: false`; MCP additionally reports `isError` and retains the domain
payload under `structuredContent.result`. Creation can leave a branch with
partial file changes if an upstream operation fails after branch creation.
Unsafe repository-relative paths are rejected before a branch is created.

REST uses `/api-gateway/v1/ledgers/{owner}/{name}/pull-requests` for creation,
`/{prNumber}` for inspection, and `/{prNumber}/approve` or `/{prNumber}/reject`
for review. The three mutations use POST; review bodies are `{}`.

### Ledger lifecycle

`manageLedgers` requires administrative authority and applies changes
immediately. It offers no preview.

- `create` requires `name` and accepts `description`, `private`, and `template`
  (`STARTER` or `SAMPLE`; omission selects starter files). Names use lowercase
  letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, up to 100 characters. Creation
  uses the authenticated account and accepts no `ledger` selector; the existing
  account policy also permits creation with a ledger-pinned admin credential.
- `update` accepts `ledger` and optional `name`, `description`, and `private`.
- `delete` accepts only `ledger` and returns `{ "ledgerId": "owner/name" }`.

For update/delete, unpinned credentials must supply `ledger`; pinned credentials
may omit it and cannot select another ledger. Creation and update return ledger
metadata and clone URLs. REST exposes `POST /api-gateway/v1/ledgers` and
`PUT`/`DELETE /api-gateway/v1/ledgers/{owner}/{name}`.

Deletion uses the same cleanup sequence as GraphQL: it attempts remote bank
revocation, then deletes local bank metadata and the repository. If repository
deletion fails, local metadata rolls back, but earlier bank revocations cannot
be undone. If the preliminary repository-ID lookup fails, bank cleanup is
skipped and repository deletion still proceeds.

### SSH public keys

These account operations use the authenticated caller and require administrative
account authority. They accept no user or ledger selector. A ledger pin does
not prevent the caller from managing their own SSH public keys.

- Read `beancount://account/public-keys{?page,limit}` to list keys.
- Read `beancount://account/public-key{?keyId}` to inspect a key by ID.
- Call `managePublicKeys` with `operation: "create"`, `key`, and `title` to add
  an SSH public key. Optional `readOnly` defaults to `false`.
- Call `managePublicKeys` with `operation: "delete"` and `keyId` to remove it.

Creation returns the ID, fingerprint, public key, title, creation time, and
optional last-use time; deletion returns `{ "id": ... }`. These changes apply
immediately and offer no preview. Key validity, uniqueness, and ownership use
the same repository-service checks as GraphQL. REST exposes the same operations
at `/api-gateway/v1/public-keys` and `/api-gateway/v1/public-keys/{keyId}`.

### Collaborator changes

`manageLedgerCollaborators` requires `ledger.admin` and the current relationship
for its selected operation. Supply `ledger: "owner/name"` for an unpinned
credential; a pinned credential can omit it.

| Operation | Arguments                                                                    | Effect                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `update`  | Required `collaborator`; optional `permission` (`read`, `write`, or `admin`) | Add or update membership, subject to the existing collaborator limit. Omitted or null permission uses the repository default. |
| `delete`  | Required `collaborator`                                                      | Remove that member.                                                                                                           |
| `leave`   | No collaborator or permission argument                                       | Remove the authenticated caller. Owners cannot leave their own ledger.                                                        |

These operations apply immediately; preview is not supported. Extra branch
arguments and `dry_run` are rejected. A membership removal affects the next
protected call.

## Resources

Resources provide URI-addressed context, separate from `tools/call`, following
MCP's [resource model](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/resources).
Discover them with **`resources/templates/list`**, then instantiate a URI and
send `resources/read`. Templates are the complete inventory. `resources/list`
enumerates instances rather than templates, and returns a narrower set: each of
the credential's ledgers' static reads — `source-files`,
`statements/income-statement`, `statements/balance-sheet`, `accounts`,
`metadata`, `payees`, `errors` — plus up to the capped number of its source
files. A template with a required argument a URI cannot guess, such as
`{archive}` or `{prNumber}`, is not enumerable and appears only in the template
list. Clients vary in how they expose these reads to an agent.

Ledger-scoped templates start with `beancount://{owner}/{name}/`. The following table
lists the accounting and bank suffixes; replace the braces with your ledger and resource values.

| Family                                  | URI suffixes                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vocabulary (11)                         | `payees`, `narrations`, `currencies`, `tags`, `links`, `years`, `commodities`, `events`, `errors`, `attributes`, `managed-prices`                         |
| Analysis without required arguments (6) | `trial-balance`, `interval-totals`, `account-last-entries`, `entries-count`, `postings-per-account`, `account-directives`                                 |
| Analysis with required arguments (5)    | `account-report/{accountName}`, `payee-transactions/{payee}`, `narration-transactions/{narration}`, `payee-accounts/{payee}`, `entry-context/{entryHash}` |
| Bank connections and accounts (4)       | `banks`, `banks/{itemId}`, `banks/{itemId}/accounts`, `bank-accounts`                                                                                     |
| Bank staging and suggestions (3)        | `bank-transactions/unsynced{?accountId}`, `bank-transactions/suggested-categories{?accountId}`, `banks/{itemId}/suggested-mapping`                        |
| File contents (1)                       | `files/{+path}`                                                                                                                                           |

The file template uses reserved expansion, `{+path}`, so nested paths work:
`beancount://alice/books/files/2026/september.bean`. It returns `text/plain`;
JSON resources return `application/json` as text inside the MCP `contents`
array; archive resources return binary blobs as described above. Read a URI through MCP, not with an ordinary HTTP GET to `beancount://`.

Journal resources are `journal`, `plaintext-journal`, `account-journal`, and
`source-files` under `beancount://{owner}/{name}/`. REST uses the same suffixes.
Journal subtype filters (`directiveTypes`, `transactionSubtypes`,
`documentSubtypes`, `customSubtypes`) are JSON-encoded string arrays in URL
parameters, for example `directiveTypes=%5B%22Transaction%22%5D`. Empty arrays
are preserved. Plaintext journal returns `{ "content": "..." }`.

Account journal requires `account`, accepts `filter`, `time`, `limit`, `offset`,
`with_children`, and `conversion`, and defaults to 20 entries, offset 0,
`with_children=true`, and `conversion=at_cost`. Source files returns filenames
from the ledger service, rather than a repository directory listing.

Additional report resources are `overview`, `documents`, `accounts`,
`statements/income-statement`, and `statements/balance-sheet` under
`beancount://{owner}/{name}/`. Statements and overview accept `account`, `filter`,
`time`, `conversion`, and `interval`; defaults are `USD` and `monthly`, matching
GraphQL. Documents accept `account`, `filter`, and `time`. Accounts accept
`status=open` or `status=closed`; other values return all accounts as in GraphQL.

`entries-count` and `postings-per-account` accept the same optional `account`,
`filter`, and `time` arguments. Time filters use the Fava-compatible clamped
report stream (including generated opening/transfer entries). An account filter
on `postings-per-account` selects matching entries and counts every posting on
those entries, including counterpart accounts; zero-count accounts are omitted
and rows are sorted by account name.

Statement and overview payloads retain the ledger service's snake-case field
names on REST/MCP. GraphQL exposes camel-case equivalents, including
`balance_children` → `balanceChildren`, `has_txns` → `hasTxns`, and
`account_balances` → `accountBalances`. Currency and account dictionary keys,
and decimal strings inside them, are unchanged.

Collaborator reads also require `ledger.admin` and current administrative
access, even though they do not modify data:

- `beancount://{owner}/{name}/collaborators{?page,limit}` lists members and their
  permissions, defaulting to page `1` and limit `10`.
- `beancount://{owner}/{name}/collaborators/permission{?collaborator}` reads one
  member's permission and user information. `collaborator` is required.

Optional user fields omitted in REST/MCP appear as `null` when selected in
GraphQL. The workflow preserves its existing behavior: a failed per-member
permission request omits that member from listing, while a failed standalone
permission request fails the call.

Ledger metadata is available at `beancount://{owner}/{name}/metadata`.
Account discovery resources need no ledger target:

- `beancount://catalog/ledgers{?page,limit}` lists accessible ledgers.
- `beancount://catalog/ledgers/owned{?page,limit}` lists owned ledgers.
- `beancount://catalog/ledgers/search{?q,topic,includeDesc,uid,priorityOwnerId,teamId,starredBy,private,isPrivate,template,archived,mode,exclusive,sort,order,page,limit}` searches with the GraphQL search contract.

A pinned credential receives only its ledger from accessible listing (page one;
subsequent pages are empty). Owned/search results omit other ledgers from the
returned upstream page. Unpinned credentials use the caller's account catalog.

The legacy `ledgerMeta` shape is available at
`GET /api-gateway/v1/legacy/ledger-meta`. Its optional `userId` is a compatibility
argument; authentication determines the caller. The legacy metadata and journal operations
preserve the historical default: omitted `ledgerId` uses the credential pin,
then the caller's first ledger if unpinned. Explicit targets still cannot expand
a pin. Ordinary MCP ledger tools continue to require an explicit target for an
unpinned credential.

Legacy `journalEntries` is available at
`GET /api-gateway/v1/legacy/journal-entries`. It accepts `first`, `after`,
`last`, `before`, `detailed`, `searchQuery`, `accountFilter`, `amountMin`,
`amountMax`, `entryTypes`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, and `groupBy` as query
parameters. `entryTypes` is a JSON-encoded string array. The response preserves
legacy posting conversions, computed fields, and `pageInfo`; its ledger is the
credential pin or the caller's first ledger, as in GraphQL.

Boolean query values are `true` or `false`. REST exposes the same owned/search
operations at `/api-gateway/v1/ledgers/owned` and `/api-gateway/v1/ledgers/search`.

Analysis resources accept their supported optional `account`, `filter`, `time`,
`interval`, `conversion`, and `accountName` inputs as URL query parameters. The
resource template advertises each read's accepted names. For example:

```text
beancount://alice/books/trial-balance?time=2026&interval=month&conversion=USD
```

Encode path values and query values using standard URL encoding. Required
arguments retain their existing path position, such as
`account-report/Expenses%3AGroceries?time=2026`. Unknown or repeated query
parameters are refused before the report runs.

Bank connection/account resources require admin capability. Staged transactions
and suggestions use read capability, with current bank and ledger relationships
checked separately. The two bank suggestion resources also require AI-use
authority. A read resource can invoke suggestion services; do not assume every
resource is a static stored document.
See [`mcp-resources.ts`](../src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-resources.ts) for the
catalog and service calls.

## Prompts

Four prompts bring the `beancount-*` ledger playbooks to agents that cannot read
`skills/`. A prompt is text the user selects. It does no ledger work itself: each
call it tells the agent to make is authorized when that tool or resource runs,
with the credential's scopes and ledger restriction.

| Prompt               | Arguments (all optional)                                        | What it asks the agent to do                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spending-report`    | `period` (`2026-08`, `last quarter`), `question`, `ledger`      | Answer spending questions without writing, showing the BQL behind every figure                                                                                                                                      |
| `close-month`        | `month` (`YYYY-MM`), `ledger`                                   | Walk a month-end close and report unverified accounts and unpinned assertions instead of claiming a finished close                                                                                                  |
| `reconcile-account`  | `account`, `period`, `statement` (CSV or pasted text), `ledger` | Classify every difference against one statement, then append missing entries and a balance assertion after confirmation                                                                                             |
| `categorize-imports` | `item_id`, `ledger`                                             | Categorize staged bank transactions into existing accounts, flag duplicates, and submit after confirmation. Listing linked banks needs `ledger.admin`; otherwise pass `item_id` or work with what is already staged |

`month` must be `YYYY-MM` and `ledger` must be `owner/name`; a malformed value is
refused rather than folded into the playbook. A credential restricted to one
ledger is told that ledger, and a `ledger` argument outside the restriction is
named as refused.

**Selecting a prompt does not approve its writes.** A playbook that writes shows
the proposed entries and waits for an explicit yes, and a read-only credential
stays read-only whatever the answer.

### Using prompts from a client

- **Claude Code** lists each prompt as a slash command, such as
  `/mcp__beancount__spending-report 2026-08`. Arguments are positional in the
  order shown above, so `reconcile-account` takes `account` before `period`.
  Paste a multi-line statement in your next message rather than on the command
  line.
- **Codex** 0.154.0 documents MCP tools but not prompts. Retrieve the playbook
  with `prompts/get` as shown in
  [Inspect the protocol with curl](#inspect-the-protocol-with-curl), and send its
  text as your first message.

Clients with MCP prompt support offer the same four prompts in their own picker.
The [MCP agent journeys](./mcp-agent-eval.md) run all four playbooks through both
clients.

## Inspect the protocol with curl

Set `BEANCOUNT_MCP_URL` to your full endpoint and `BEANCOUNT_MCP_TOKEN` to a
ledger-scoped credential in your local environment. The following requests only
discover capabilities and query balances. The balance query as written assumes a
credential pinned to one ledger; with an unpinned credential, add
`"ledger": "owner/name"` to its `arguments` (the call then refuses with
`Select a ledger using ledger: owner/name` instead of guessing):

```bash
mcp_post() {
  curl --silent --show-error --no-buffer --max-time 30 \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $BEANCOUNT_MCP_TOKEN" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
    --header "MCP-Protocol-Version: ${BEANCOUNT_MCP_VERSION:-2025-11-25}" \
    --data "$1" \
    "$BEANCOUNT_MCP_URL"
}

mcp_post '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"beancount-guide","version":"1.0.0"}}}'
```

Read `result.protocolVersion` from the initialization response and set
`BEANCOUNT_MCP_VERSION` to that negotiated value before continuing:

```bash
mcp_post '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}'
mcp_post '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}'
mcp_post '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"resources/templates/list"}'
mcp_post '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"runBqlQuery","arguments":{"query":"BALANCES"}}}'
```

A client without a prompt picker retrieves a [prompt](#prompts)'s text and
sends it as its first message. With `jq` installed:

```bash
mcp_post '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":6,"method":"prompts/get","params":{"name":"spending-report","arguments":{"period":"2026-08"}}}' \
  | sed -n 's/^data: //p' | jq -r '.result.messages[0].content.text'
```

For a credential pinned to `alice/books`, a resource read is:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 5,
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": { "uri": "beancount://alice/books/trial-balance" }
}
```

The SDK may frame a response as SSE (`event: message`, then `data: {...}`), so
the entire response body is not necessarily a JSON document. An accepted
notification returns `202` without a body. A full client should use an MCP SDK
to handle framing, initialization, and version negotiation.

## Results and failures

The common [rate limiter](../src/server/api/rate-limit.ts) counts calls per
credential and operation. Default budgets are 300 read, 60 write, and 30 admin
calls per minute; `manageApiKeys` carries the five-per-minute mint override
because its create branch mints. These are
operation-class budgets, not one combined allowance for the entire MCP endpoint.

The MCP endpoint itself also carries a read-class transport budget, and the
handshake — `initialize`, its acknowledgement, `tools/list`,
`resources/templates/list`, `prompts/list`, and `ping` — is charged to a
separate, far larger bucket instead of the session's own. A long session is
therefore bounded by the work it does, not by how many JSON-RPC messages it
took to do it, while a client that only ever posts `{"method":"ping"}` is still
bounded by something. `prompts/get` and `resources/list` are deliberately
charged as work: one is the caller choosing to do something, the other
enumerates ledgers and source files.

### The result envelope

The text block is what a person would read and `structuredContent` is what a
program parses. They are no longer the same bytes: a BQL result arrives as the
row count and the rendered table, while the typed rows stay in
`structuredContent`.

```json
{ "ok": true, "result": "tool-specific payload" }
```

A failure sets the MCP result's **`isError: true`** and carries one envelope on
every tool:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNBALANCED",
    "message": "Transaction does not balance: residual 5 USD",
    "hint": "Postings do not sum to zero. Add the missing posting, elide one amount, or pass `allowInvalid: true` to record it deliberately."
  }
}
```

Branch on `error.code`; `error.hint` names the next call to make. `retryAfter`
is present only for `RATE_LIMITED`. Arguments that do not match a tool's
published input schema are refused the same way, before any work runs:
`BAD_USER_INPUT` with a message of the form `path: reason`, where `path` names
the field (`files.0.start_line` for a nested one). An unknown tool name answers
`NOT_FOUND`. Check `isError` first — HTTP 200 does not
mean the tool succeeded.

Each tool advertises an object `outputSchema`: `ok` is required, with optional
`result` and `error`. Its fields are intentionally undocumented there — the
envelope is identical on every tool, so describing it once here costs one copy
instead of twenty-five in each `tools/list`. The runtime success/failure
convention is stronger than that published schema because the SDK requires an
object schema here. See
[`types.ts`](../src/features/ai-agent/tools/types.ts) and MCP's
[structured tool results](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/tools#structured-content).

### Failure codes

The same codes reach resource reads and prompt fetches, as the JSON-RPC error's
`data`, with the message unprefixed so a client's SDK adds exactly one
`MCP error <n>:` prefix. That covers the two mistakes a client makes before any
handler runs: a `beancount://` URI matching no template answers `NOT_FOUND`
(`-32002`) with a hint naming `resources/templates/list`, and a malformed
`month` or `ledger` argument to a prompt answers `BAD_USER_INPUT` (`-32602`)
naming the argument. A resource URI that matches a template but is malformed —
an unknown or repeated query parameter, a `#` fragment, or invalid percent
encoding — also answers `BAD_USER_INPUT` (`-32602`), with a hint naming what the
template accepts. A URI under another scheme is not this server's to answer
and still returns the SDK's own refusal.

The backend needs its normal PostgreSQL, Redis, ledger, and repository services.
Apply database migrations, including the API-key tables, before testing keys.
In production, configure `DASHBOARD_URL` as the public OAuth front door and
provide `OAUTH_JWKS` as a complete private ES256/P-256 JWKS with a `kid` per key.
Missing or malformed signing configuration disables OAuth routes and discovery.
Development uses an ephemeral signing key, so restarting the backend invalidates
existing development OAuth access tokens.

Route `/api-gateway/*` and the discovery paths under `/.well-known/*` to the
backend, and consent pages to the dashboard. Preserve authorization headers and
SSE responses. See the [OAuth deployment contract](../README.md#oauth-deployment-contract)
and [well-known path inventory](../../../docs/adrs/ADR009-backend-v2-well-known-paths.md).

`/.well-known/mcp.json` is a Beancount discovery manifest with the endpoint and
descriptor-derived tool/resource catalogs. Its current `auth.scopes` field
contains the old `read`/`write` labels; use OAuth protected-resource metadata and
the `ledger.*` scope names above when requesting permissions.

From `backend-cluster/backend-v2/`, run:

```bash
yarn mcp:conformance https://books.example.com
yarn mcp:conformance https://books.example.com --token "$BEANCOUNT_MCP_TOKEN"
```

The [conformance script](../scripts/mcp-conformance.ts) checks the unauthenticated
challenge, discovery, method handling, initialization/tool schemas, error masking,
and canonical path. Checks requiring absent credentials are **skipped**, not
passed. It does not complete browser OAuth or verify all resource reads.

An optional `--read-only-token` checks refusal of a file write. Supply only a
credential restricted to `ledger.read`: the probe attempts a real create-file
operation and does not set `dry_run`. Do not supply a write/admin credential to
that flag.

Conformance says whether a client can connect. To see whether real coding agents
complete ordinary ledger tasks through the surface — correct answers, the right
ledger changes, and the calls, time, and cost it took — run the
[MCP agent journeys](./mcp-agent-eval.md) with Claude Code and Codex.

### Publishing the registry listing

The listing is [`server.json`](../server.json) at this package's root: name,
title, a description of at most 100 characters, `version`, the repository, an
icon, and one `streamable-http` remote at `https://beancount.io/api-gateway/mcp`.
A test in [`well-known-route.test.ts`](../src/features/well-known/api/__tests__/well-known-route.test.ts)
fails if its remote URL or version drifts from what `/.well-known/mcp.json`
advertises.

The registry grants the `io.beancount/*` namespace to whoever proves control of
`beancount.io`. This deployment proves it over HTTP: `MCP_REGISTRY_AUTH_PROOF`
holds the public half of an Ed25519 key as the record
`v=MCPv1; k=ed25519; p=<base64 public key>`, and the backend serves it at
`GET /.well-known/mcp-registry-auth`. Unset, the route answers 404 — a self-host
must not serve Beancount.io's key, because that would let Beancount.io publish
under the self-host's namespace. The registry also accepts a DNS TXT record with
the same content at the domain apex; this repository documents only the HTTP
path.

Generate the key pair with OpenSSL 3 (macOS's system LibreSSL lacks Ed25519 in
`genpkey`; `brew install openssl@3` and call that binary):

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out key.pem
# MCP_REGISTRY_AUTH_PROOF — the public record production serves
echo "v=MCPv1; k=ed25519; p=$(openssl pkey -in key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | base64)"
# MCP_REGISTRY_PRIVATE_KEY — 64 hex characters, the GitHub environment secret
openssl pkey -in key.pem -noout -text | grep -A3 "priv:" | tail -n +2 | tr -d ' :\n'
```

Keep `key.pem` and the hex private key out of the repository.

Publishing runs in GitHub Actions. The `Publish (mcp registry)` workflow
([`publish-mcp-registry.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/publish-mcp-registry.yml))
validates `server.json` on every pull request or push that touches it, and
publishes on a push to `main` whose commits changed it, or on a
`workflow_dispatch` with `publish` set. The publish job runs under the
`mcp-registry-publish` environment, whose secret `MCP_REGISTRY_PRIVATE_KEY` is
the hex private key; restrict that environment to `main` and add a required
reviewer. Before signing in, the job checks that production serves the proof
record and that the registry does not already have this version.

Published versions are immutable. To change anything in the listing, bump
`version` in `server.json` — the registry marks the highest semantic version
`latest` — or the publish fails with a message saying so.

To publish by hand instead, from `backend-cluster/backend-v2/`:

```bash
mcp-publisher validate server.json
mcp-publisher login http --domain beancount.io --private-key "$MCP_REGISTRY_PRIVATE_KEY"
mcp-publisher publish server.json
```

Verify either path:

```bash
curl -fsS https://beancount.io/.well-known/mcp-registry-auth
curl -fsS "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers/io.beancount%2Fbeancount/versions/latest" \
  | jq '{_meta, server: (.server | {name, version, remotes})}'
```

### Repository history resources

All three require repository read access to the URI's ledger:

- `beancount://{owner}/{name}/latest-commit{?branchName}` returns the latest
  commit, or `null` for an empty repository. `branchName` defaults to `main`.
- `beancount://{owner}/{name}/commits{?branch,page,limit}` returns commit history.
  Defaults are `main`, page `1`, and limit `30`.
- `beancount://{owner}/{name}/commit-details{?sha}` requires `sha` and returns
  metadata, parents, file statistics, and a unified diff.

Percent-encode branch names and SHA query values when constructing a URI.

### Public configuration reads

`beancount://configuration/health` returns the JSON string `"OK"`, matching
GraphQL `health` and `GET /api-gateway/v1/health`. This is an application probe,
not a check of database or ledger-service readiness.

`beancount://configuration/feature-flags{?userId}` matches GraphQL
`featureFlags(userId: ...)` and `GET /api-gateway/v1/feature-flags?userId=...`.
The legacy `userId` argument is optional, but currently does
not change the static `{ "spendingReportSubscription": false }` result.

These REST and GraphQL reads allow anonymous callers. MCP still requires its
transport credential, but neither resource requires ledger scopes or a ledger
target. The REST OpenAPI security alternatives explicitly mark anonymous access;
protected ledger routes continue to require credentials.

`beancount://configuration/tier-quotas` returns the public quota catalog, matching
GraphQL `allTierQuotas` and anonymous `GET /api-gateway/v1/tier-quotas`. Every row
includes `tier`, `maxLedgers`, `maxCollaboratorsPerLedger`, `aiCfoTokensMax`, and
`maxDirectives`. A limit of `-1` means unlimited. This static catalog does not
read a customer's subscription or contact Stripe.

### Account profile

`beancount://account/profile{?userId}` matches GraphQL `userProfile` and
`GET /api-gateway/v1/user-profile`. Omit `userId` to read the caller's profile;
an explicit ID must name that same user. The account service enforces read
capability and exact-self authorization independently of a credential's ledger
pin. Results include identity fields, locale, report status, subscription tier,
ledger limits, and whether the user has ever subscribed.

A missing user returns JSON `null`. The REST and GraphQL identity probes also
return `null` anonymously without loading account data. The MCP transport
continues to require a credential.

### Account deletion

`deleteAccount` takes an empty object and matches GraphQL `deleteAccount` and
`DELETE /api-gateway/v1/account`. It permanently deletes the authenticated
account, with no user/ledger selector or preview. The existing credential policy
allows session and OAuth identities; API keys are refused even with an admin
scope. The operation's `admin` classification is audit/rate metadata, not a new
scope requirement. A ledger pin does not change which account is deleted.

All adapters call the existing account service: cancel active subscriptions,
attempt bank disconnection, remove local account-related rows and the ledger
user, then clear email-token storage. A failed subscription cancellation stops
later cleanup. A failed ledger-user deletion rolls back local transactional
rows; earlier external cancellation or disconnection cannot be rolled back.
Email-token cleanup happens after that transaction. These cross-system partial
failure boundaries are shared with GraphQL.

### Public social lists

The MCP resources below match public REST routes and GraphQL list queries:

| Resource                                  | REST GET route                                | GraphQL query         |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `beancount://social/followers`            | `/api-gateway/v1/social/followers`            | `getUserFollowers`    |
| `beancount://social/following`            | `/api-gateway/v1/social/following`            | `getUserFollowing`    |
| `beancount://social/starred-repositories` | `/api-gateway/v1/social/starred-repositories` | `getUserStarredRepos` |

Every route/resource requires a `username` query argument and accepts `page`
and `limit`, defaulting to 1 and 20. Encode query values once. Responses retain
user/repository fields and ISO timestamps. `total` is the returned page's size,
not the overall collection size. The shared service currently returns an empty
page on upstream failure, so an empty result does not establish that the user
has no followers or stars. REST/GraphQL allow anonymous requests; MCP retains
its transport credential requirement but needs no ledger scope or target.

`beancount://social/profile{?username}` matches GraphQL `getUserProfile(username: ...)`
and `GET /api-gateway/v1/social/profile?username=...`. It returns the public profile,
follow status when authenticated, activities, and repositories. Under the existing
GraphQL contract, viewing your own username uses your authenticated Gitea client
and may include private activities/repositories; other usernames and anonymous
views use the public client. This existing self-enrichment is independent of
ledger scopes/pins. Activity and repository reads retain their 20/50 limits.

GraphQL represents an anonymous `isFollowing` as null; REST omits it. A failed
activity or repository read falls back to an empty collection independently;
failing to fetch the profile itself fails the operation on every adapter.

### Ledger stars

`setLedgerStar({ starred: true, ledger: "owner/name" })` stars a ledger for the
caller; `starred: false` removes the star. A pinned credential may omit `ledger`.
The REST equivalents are `PUT` and `DELETE` on
`/api-gateway/v1/ledgers/{owner}/{name}/star`, matching GraphQL `starLedger` and
`unstarLedger`. These operations require write capability and current read
access to the target, with ledger pins enforced on each call. No preview is
supported.

All surfaces preserve `{ success, isStarred, message }`. Upstream write failures
return `success:false`; MCP also marks the call as an error while retaining
that result. Authorization refusals occur before the upstream write. Repeated
starring retains one star, and access is checked again before unstar.

### Temporary asset upload and download

`generateTempAssetUploadUrl` accepts optional `filename` and `mimeType` and
returns `uploadUrl`, `objectKey`, and `expiresIn` (seconds). PUT the bytes to the
returned URL with the supplied MIME type. Then use the object key in an ingestion
operation or read `beancount://temp-assets/download-url{?objectKey}` to obtain a
`downloadUrl` and its `expiresIn`.

The existing policy requires read capability for both operations, including URL
creation. Neither requires a ledger target. Keys are bound to the authenticated
user; foreign, permanent, and malformed references receive a concealed denial.
The upload tool has no preview. Issuing a URL does not upload data or establish
that an object exists. URLs retain their configured lifetime once issued.

### AI CFO usage

Read `beancount://account/ai-cfo-usage` for `aiCfoTokensUsed` and
`aiCfoTokensMax`, matching GraphQL's `aiCfoUsage` fields. Usage is for the current
UTC billing month and the authenticated account. Read capability is required;
API keys and ledger-pinned credentials retain the existing account-read policy.
No user or ledger selector is accepted. This read does not consume AI tokens.

### Parse uploaded statements

Call `parseFile` with `s3ObjectKey` and `fileFormat` after uploading a file.
It returns `rows`, each containing `date`, `payee`, `description`, and numeric
`amount`, matching GraphQL's file parser. It preserves the caller-supplied format
and uses the stored MIME type. No ledger selector is needed, including for an
unpinned credential. The existing policy allows read capability and requires
ownership of the temporary upload.
The operation checks quota first and charges the actor for completed extraction;
it does not insert ledger entries and has no preview mode.

### Suggest transaction categories

Read `beancount://{owner}/{name}/import/suggest-categories` with a
`transactions` query parameter carrying a JSON-encoded array of
`{rowIndex, date, payee, description, amount}` objects — the same shape GraphQL
`suggestTransactionCategories` accepts, with no batch minimum. The result is an
array of `{rowIndex, targetAccount, confidence, source, reasoning?}`
suggestions drawn from the ledger's open accounts and recent transaction
history; ledgers using an auto-accounts plugin may receive accounts outside the
current list. Requires read capability plus current content and AI-write access
to the selected ledger, and consumes AI quota on completion. REST serves the
same contract at
`POST /api-gateway/v1/ledgers/{owner}/{name}/import/suggest-categories`.

### Parse receipts and recommend accounts

`parseReceipt` accepts `objectKey` (GraphQL/REST's `s3ObjectKey`) and optional
`ledger: "owner/name"`. Only pinned credentials can omit the ledger. The upload
must be a caller-owned temporary image or PDF, and the caller must retain read
access to the selected ledger's contents and assets. Existing read-capability
policy is preserved.

The result contains `date`, `payee`, `description`, `amount`, and optional
`sourceAccount`/`targetAccount`. An unknown date is null. Missing recommendations
are omitted in REST/MCP and null in GraphQL. Closed accounts are excluded from
the recommendation input. Extraction and recommendation token usage is charged
together to the actor after successful completion. This operation does not
insert a transaction and offers no preview.

### Insert receipt transactions

`insertReceiptTransaction` promotes a confirmed receipt into the ledger:
`receiptObjectKey` names the caller-owned temporary upload, and `input` carries
`date`, `payee`, `description`, an arbitrary-count `postings` array of
`{account, amountNumber, amountCurrency}` string-decimal legs, and
`documentAccount`. Optional `ledger` follows the standard selection contract.
The ledger's `receipt_storage` beancountio-option decides the strategy: S3
storage promotes the object and writes one transaction with a receipt URL in
its metadata; git storage commits the receipt bytes into the repository and
writes a link-tagged document plus transaction pair. Requires write capability
with current content and asset write access; unowned temporary keys are
concealed as not found. The result is `{success}`. No preview; a failed entry
write keeps the temporary upload for retry.

`renameLedgerFile` accepts `oldPath`, `newPath`, optional `message`, optional
`updateIncludes`, and optional `ledger`. Pinned credentials may omit the
ledger; unpinned callers must select it. The protected workflow validates both
repository-relative paths and moves the file preserving its content in one
atomic commit (default message `Rename oldPath → newPath`). When `oldPath`
is still `include`d, the rename is refused unless `updateIncludes: true`
rewrites those lines in the same commit. The result contains `oldPath` and
`newPath`. Write capability and current content-write access are required.

This operation exposes GraphQL's existing contract: it has no caller-supplied
SHA or preview flag. Repository conflicts remain errors.

### Update or delete entry source

`editEntrySource` exposes three operations through the existing journal service:

- `update`: `entryHash`, `sha256sum`, and `newContent`; returns `message`,
  `newSha256sum`, and `newEntryHash` — the request's `entryHash` is stale
  after the commit, so use `newEntryHash` for the next edit.
- `delete`: `entryHash` and `sha256sum`; returns `message` and `entryHash`.
- `delete_many`: `entries: [{entryHash, sha256sum}]`; returns `message` and
  `deletedCount`.

Use the current source checksum returned by entry context. Each branch accepts
only its own arguments and optional `ledger`; a pinned credential may omit the
ledger. Current content-write access is required. The operation delegates source
validation and mutation to the ledger service and does not support preview.

### Insert structured directives

`addLedgerEntries` accepts `entries: [{type, entry}]` and optional `ledger`.
Only pinned credentials can omit the ledger. It supports transaction, commodity,
price, note, balance, open, close, budget, document, and event directives using
the REST input shapes. GraphQL instead uses an uppercase enum and a payload field
named after the directive; its budget interval enum maps to lowercase here.

The tool uses the real entry writer, including file routing and the normal web
quota policy. Every write result carries the write outcome first: a `summary`
of what was written and how many new bean-check errors it introduced, then
`wrote` (files touched), `entryHashes`, and `validation` (`errorsBefore`,
`errorsAfter`, `newErrors`) — learn about a broken ledger from the write
result itself instead of re-reading the errors resource. A transaction with at
most one amount omitted is written elided; any other imbalance is refused with
`UNBALANCED` unless `allowInvalid: true` records it deliberately. It is
distinct from raw file editing. REST and MCP impose no separate batch-size
limit beyond the shared ledger contract. Optional null fields are treated as
absent. Transaction metadata accepts string-valued objects on all three
surfaces. Ledger-side date, posting, and quota validation still applies.
There is no preview argument.

### Legacy transaction insertion

The legacy entry tool left the MCP surface (compat-only exemption): agents
should use `addLedgerEntries` for modern structured directives. The REST twin
`POST /api-gateway/v1/legacy/entries` and GraphQL `addEntries` remain for older
clients: supply `entriesInput` with `type: "Transaction"`, date, flag, meta,
narration, payee, and postings containing account and amount strings. Legacy
metadata is required but ignored, including its filename; the writer still uses
ledger routing rules. Amounts such as `1,000.25 EUR` retain their historical
conversion. Other directive types are refused.

Optional `ledgerId` preserves the legacy order: explicit target, credential pin,
then the caller's first accessible ledger. This compatibility operation retains
that fallback rather than the modern tools' explicit-selection requirement.
Current target write authorization and normal web quotas still apply. The result
is `{data:"",success:true}`. No preview is offered.
