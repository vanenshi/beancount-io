# Beancount.io Backend

Node.js and TypeScript service providing GraphQL, REST, git-proxy, agent, and scheduled-job surfaces for Beancount.io.

## Architecture

Code is feature-oriented, with shared infrastructure under `src/foundation/`, transport setup under `src/server/`, and reusable utilities under `src/shared/`.

Feature-specific guidance cascades from:

- `src/features/gitea/AGENTS.md`
- `src/features/ledger/AGENTS.md`
- `src/features/plaid/AGENTS.md`

The usual feature shape is `api/` for transport adapters, `service/` for single-domain behavior, `workflow/` for orchestration, `data/` for persistence, and `utils/` for pure helpers. Use only the directories the feature needs.

## Dependency and layer rules

The current dependency direction is:

```
GraphQL resolver / REST handler / MCP handler
        ↓
Workflow (multi-service orchestration) or Service (single-domain operation)
        ↓
Service / Client factory
        ↓
Model + database / external API
```

- GraphQL resolvers, REST handlers, and MCP tool/resource handlers are transport adapters. They authenticate, validate, map request/response types, set transport state, and delegate. They do not access models or orchestrate several services.
- Workflows own cross-service coordination, transaction boundaries, locking, and multi-step use cases. Their inputs and outputs are plain domain types; a workflow must not import GraphQL DTOs from `api/`.
- Services own one reusable domain capability. They may call models and external-client factories through narrow interfaces, but they stay transport-agnostic.
- Models perform persistence for one aggregate. They contain queries and CRUD, not tier rules, cross-model workflows, or cache policy. Redis-backed token/session models are persistence, not caches.
- Existing `operations/` functions are small, explicitly injected domain operations used by services/workflows. New multi-service orchestration belongs in a workflow rather than a resolver or service-locator function.

Use constructor injection and the narrowest dependency contract:

- Declare an `I<Name>` interface beside every service/workflow class and have the class implement it. Reference the interface in consumers and tests; name concrete classes only where constructing them.
- Slice broad contracts with `Pick<IModels, ...>` and `Pick<AppConfig, ...>` when a unit needs only a few members.
- Pass request identity (`userId`, token, ledger ID) as method input. Do not put application services into GraphQL context.
- A resolver may call one service directly for a simple operation. If it must coordinate multiple services, add or extend a workflow.

## Composition root

The application dependency graph is explicit:

- `src/foundation/factory.ts` connects PostgreSQL and Redis and returns `AppLayers`.
- `src/foundation/composition/layers.ts` defines Database → ClientFactory → Service → Workflow layer contracts.
- `src/foundation/composition/builder.ts` constructs services and workflows bottom-up.
- `src/server/graphql/resolver-registry.ts` constructs resolvers and is the only GraphQL resolver registration list.
- `src/server/graphql/api-gateway.ts` passes the resolver container to TypeGraphQL.
- `src/server/api/composition-root.ts` assembles the transport surfaces: one REST router, one GraphQL schema, and one MCP registry, built from per-feature registration fragments. There is no `server-routes.ts`, `rest/rest-routes.ts`, or `graphql/index.ts`; a feature exposes itself by registering a fragment, not by being wired into a route list.

When adding a constructor-injected resolver, register both its class and instance in `resolver-registry.ts`. The container intentionally throws if a resolver with constructor parameters was not wired.

## Caching

Application caches use `CacheHelper` from `src/shared/cache/`, not the raw cache-manager instance.

- Use `getOrSet` for read-through caches; it guards stampedes and fails open.
- Use `get` / `set` / `del` for non-critical caches and `getStrict` / `setStrict` / `delStrict` for Redis-backed persistence where a dropped write must fail.
- Use `TTL` and `CACHE_KEYS`; do not add raw duration literals or ad-hoc key strings.
- The Redis codec preserves `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, and `BigInt`; do not manually rehydrate cached values.
- The sitemap cache is intentionally file-backed because it stores large, persisted XML.

## Data models and IDs

New primary keys use `prefixedNanoidBase58()` from `@/shared/nanoid-base58` with a documented lowercase resource prefix ending in `_` (for example `ptxn_`). Define IDs as Drizzle `text(...).primaryKey()` columns. Do not introduce bare NanoIDs, integer IDs, ObjectIDs, or UUIDs for new models.

Every data model exposes an interface from its `types.ts`, and the implementation implements that interface. Add a new model to the registry under `src/foundation/models/` and include its schema in the Drizzle setup/migration flow.

## Errors and logging

- Throw transport-agnostic `DomainError` subclasses from `@/shared/errors`; do not throw GraphQL- or REST-specific errors from domain code.
- GraphQL translation lives in `src/server/graphql/format-error.ts`; REST translation and centralized logging live in `src/server/rest/error-middleware.ts`.
- Use `try...catch` only for recovery, fallback, cleanup, or translation that changes behavior. Do not catch only to log and rethrow.
- Tests should assert the error class and, when relevant, `category`/`metadata`, not exact prose.
- Use a module-scoped child logger from `@/shared/logger`; do not use manual `[module]` tags or `console.*` in production code. Tests and explicit developer-output scripts may use console output.
- Never log secrets, credentials, tokens, or user financial data.
- `asyncContextMiddleware` mints or adopts the request ID; `ApiClient` forwards it to the ledger service in the `x-bcio-context` envelope so both services log the same `requestId` (**ADR 016**, `../../docs/adrs/ADR016-backend-cluster-forwarded-request-context.md`). The envelope is caller-influenced, so the receiving side must never read it for authentication, authorization, or a limit decision; authority keeps its own named channels (`Authorization`, `x-directive-limit-exempt`). It carries exactly one credential — `session-token`, the caller's own, which the ledger service relays unverified to beancount.io's login-gated price routes (ADR 016 §7). That field must never be logged: `mergeContext` copies an allowlist (`LOGGABLE_CONTEXT_KEYS`), so a new context field is invisible to logs until deliberately added there; per-call detail belongs in the `meta` argument. Add a field to `forwarded-context.ts`, never by merging the inbound request's headers into the outbound call.

## Development

Run from `backend-cluster/backend-v2/`:

```zsh
yarn dev
yarn test
yarn test:integration
yarn lint
yarn lint:deadcode
yarn lint:deadcode:fix
yarn typecheck
yarn build
yarn codegen
yarn mcp:conformance <base-url>
```

`yarn lint` fixes eligible ESLint findings and then runs Knip dead-code detection. Review its diff. `yarn lint:deadcode:fix` also removes unused files, exports, and exported types; review those removals before keeping them. Unit tests live beside features in `__tests__/` — and beside the scripts in `scripts/__tests__/`, which is why Jest's `roots` covers both; integration tests use `*.integration.test.ts`.

`yarn mcp:conformance <base-url> [--token …] [--read-only-token …]` runs ADR 0007's checklist against a deployment and names the check that failed. It only observes, so it is safe to point at production; checks needing a credential skip rather than fail without one.

Code generation:

- `yarn generate-backend-v2-openapi` updates the backend REST spec.
- `yarn generate-fava-client` reads `../idl/beancount-ledger.openapi.json`.
- `yarn generate-gitea-client` reads `../idl/gitea.swagger.v1.json`; never hand-edit `src/features/gitea/client/gitea-api.ts`.
- `yarn generate-agent-tool-types` updates generated agent tool types.

Prompt and agent-routing evals live entirely under `evals/`. Use the focused `yarn eval:*` scripts while iterating and `yarn eval` for all modules. These suites make real, billed model calls unless their provider explicitly stubs the tool context, so they are manual and not part of CI.

`yarn mcp:agent-eval` is the external-client counterpart: real Claude Code and Codex sessions run the `evals/mcp-agent/` journeys against the hosted MCP endpoint with a QA account's dedicated `mcp-agent-eval` ledger, and the harness scores answers and read-back ledger state (`docs/mcp-agent-eval.md`). It is billed and opt-in; its scorers and process limits are unit-tested in `scripts/__tests__/mcp-agent-eval.test.ts`. Never provision a separate stack for it, and keep credentials in the environment — never in files the repository tracks. When a fixture value changes, update `journeys.json` and the independent oracle test together.

## API surfaces

- GraphQL: `src/server/graphql/`; resolver list and DI are in `resolver-registry.ts`.
- REST: feature handlers register fragments consumed by `src/server/api/composition-root.ts`.
- MCP: tools in `src/features/ai-agent/api/mcp-tools.ts`, resources in `mcp-resources.ts`, both registered through the same composition root and both gated per call. Reads belong in resources and actions in tools — a tool competes for the model's selection attention and a resource does not, which is what lets the read surface grow (ADR 0008 D2). Which verbs belong on which surface — and what an absence has to say for itself — is **ADR 0008** (`../../docs/adrs/ADR008-backend-v2-surface-parity.md`). The endpoint's own contract — its address, why it serves `POST` only, why a `401` is worthless unless the discovery document it names resolves, and why a tool result reading `ok: false` must carry `isError` — is **ADR 0007** (`../../docs/adrs/ADR007-backend-v2-mcp-surface.md`). Read it before changing `mcp-route.ts`; every rule in it exists because production broke without it. Prompts in `mcp-prompts.ts` are the third primitive: the `skills/.claude/skills/beancount-*` playbooks rewritten against these tools, for hosted agents that cannot see a filesystem. They are static text, so they carry no op id, no PDP action, and no parity obligation — a prompt performs no domain work, and everything it instructs is gated where the named tool or resource runs. Keep them honest about the surface that exists; `mcp-prompt-list.test.ts` fails when one names a tool that does not, or cites a `beancount://` URI that is not a registered resource template. Validate fixed-shape arguments (`month`, `ledger`) in `validatePromptArgs` so a malformed value is refused rather than folded into the playbook — in the prompt callback rather than the advertised `argsSchema`, because a constraint the SDK enforces is refused as its own `McpError`, without `data.code`, without a hint, and double-prefixed (w4/070). Prompt text is served by the deployed backend, so a repair reaches clients only after a deploy; `yarn mcp:agent-eval` measures the deployed prompts.
- OpenAPI: `GET /api-gateway/v1/openapi.json` is the published v1 contract and is served in every environment. The internal `/api-docs` and `/api-admin-docs` Swagger UI pages stay development-only.
- New documented REST endpoints use Zod schemas, `zodValidator()`, and central route registration. Import the shared `@/shared/zod-openapi-setup`; never call `extendZodWithOpenApi()` in individual schema files.

### Required API parity workflow

REST, GraphQL, and MCP are equal public contracts. An API change is complete only when every eligible surface exposes the same domain behavior and its contract tests pass. This applies to new operations, changed inputs or outputs, bug fixes, authorization changes, and deprecations.

1. **Identify all counterparts before editing.** Find the operation in `VERB_TABLE` in `src/server/api/op-class.ts`, its mounted REST route, GraphQL field, and MCP tool or resource. Read [the current parity contract](docs/api-parity.md) and its named exceptions; ADR 0008 explains the design. Eligibility follows `isReachableOn` and the current authorization action catalog, not old exemption prose or the operation's rate-limit class.
2. **Implement the change across all eligible adapters together.** Delegate to the same service/workflow and canonical authorization action. Preserve equivalent inputs, defaults, filters, pagination, output values, side effects, previews, and failure semantics. Protocol envelopes and documented field aliases may differ. Keep credential scopes, ledger pins, relationship checks, rate budgets, and audit behavior consistent while respecting each OAuth resource's audience.
3. **Register real, discoverable operations.** Update feature fragments, the GraphQL resolver registry/schema, REST declarations and validation, MCP tool/resource schemas, and the corresponding `VERB_TABLE` bindings as needed. MCP reads belong in resources; writes/admin actions belong in tools. A grouped tool must execute each advertised branch through that operation's protected service. An approximate BQL query or raw-file workaround does not substitute for an operation's contract.
4. **Keep eligible gaps at zero.** `surface-parity.test.ts` must retain `gql: 0`, `rest: 0`, and `mcp: 0`. Do not raise these counts, remove bindings, narrow eligibility, broaden credential permissions, or add exemption text to bypass missing implementation. `src/server/api/__tests__/fixtures/parity-baseline.json` is a frozen historical contract, not a snapshot to regenerate when a test fails. Preserve existing structural exceptions; a new protocol or credential-policy exception must have a concrete reason in the relevant `*Exempt` field and be documented in the parity contract/ADR as a deliberate contract change.
5. **Prove behavior through the adapters.** Add or update the affected family's contract tests using HTTP REST, GraphQL execution, and an MCP client for each eligible surface. Compare supported inputs/defaults, results, effects, and relevant validation/authorization failures. Exercise the shared domain implementation with controlled external dependencies; mocks that only assert all adapters call a service are insufficient. Preserve existing callers and document any intentional contract change.
6. **Refresh contracts and run the gate before handoff.** Regenerate `docs/openapi/v1.json` for v1 REST contract changes and affected generated types/clients when their source contracts change. Review the generated diff. From this package, run:

   ```zsh
   yarn typecheck
   yarn test
   yarn generate-v1-openapi
   ```

   `yarn test` includes the zero-gap `surface-parity`, frozen `parity-baseline`, runtime `op-class-coverage`, `always-public`, OpenAPI completeness, and behavioral contract suites. The existing [CI workflow](../../.github/workflows/ci-backend-parity.yml) runs typechecking and the unit suite, regenerates OpenAPI, and rejects snapshot drift. Keep this gate enabled; a skipped or failed check leaves the API change unverified and must be reported at handoff.

### The v1 REST surface

`src/features/ledger/api/rest/v1/` is the public ledger API. Keep endpoints easy to use with curl while covering every eligible capability under the parity workflow above; ADR 0008 and `docs/api-parity.md` define the contract.

- **Add an endpoint** by declaring a `v1Route({...})` in the relevant `*-handler.ts` and listing it in `v1/index.ts`. `registerV1Route` mounts it, validates it, requires the shared request identity, and registers it with the spec from that one declaration, so the mounted path, enforced schema/authentication, and documented contract cannot disagree.
- **Paths address a ledger as `{owner}/{name}`,** two segments, never one `{ledgerId}`. A single segment needs `%2F` to survive Cloudflare and Caddy unchanged.
- **Classify the new op** in `op-class.ts` — the coverage test fails otherwise — and remember the class comes from the table, not the HTTP method: `POST .../query` is `read`.
- **Regenerate the snapshot** with `yarn generate-v1-openapi`; `openapi-completeness.test.ts` fails when `docs/openapi/v1.json` and the live document disagree, so a contract change shows up as a reviewable diff.
- The v1 fragment is gated `enforced`, so unknown or non-PDP operations fail closed regardless of `config.api.scopeEnforcement`. Every protected v1 business verb maps to a canonical PDP action; its service/workflow makes the final credential, ledger-pin, and relationship decision. Every protected v1 resource route, including archive downloads, uses the shared identity gate; browsers present their session cookie and non-browser clients use OAuth bearer tokens or personal API keys. Public configuration reads explicitly use `anonymousV1Route`, which makes identity optional in the handler and documents anonymous access in OpenAPI; operation classification and rate limits still apply.

### Identity and op classes

Every surface authenticates through one gate and classifies every operation:

- `src/server/api/identity.ts` (`resolveIdentity`) is the single authentication seam; the REST side publishes it via `rest/identity-middleware.ts`. Request credentials normalize to a user principal with computed effective capabilities and explicit assurance. Internal work uses a distinct `system` method and service principal with an explicit on-behalf-of user; it must never masquerade as a session.
- `src/server/api/op-class.ts` holds the scope vocabulary and the op-class matrix: a stable op id per operation, classified `read` / `write` / `admin` / `session-only` / `public`. The class is rate-limit and observability metadata, not a second permission grant. Every protected business row maps to one canonical `authorizationAction`; authentication ceremonies and public operations instead carry an explicit `nonPdpReason`, while protected direct-call actions are enumerated in `DIRECT_ONLY_ACTIONS`. `graphql/scope-middleware.ts`, `rest/scope-middleware.ts`, and the MCP registry isolate the transport operation ID and fail closed on unknown operations, but PDP-routed rows defer credential reachability, ledger pins, and relationship authority to the protected service/workflow. `config.api.scopeEnforcement` is `"enforce"` as a reviewed code value, never an environment switch.
- Every GraphQL root query and mutation declares exactly one access mode from `src/server/graphql/authenticated.ts`: `@Authenticated()` when an identity is required or `@AllowAnonymous()` when the resolver intentionally accepts no identity. Never use TypeGraphQL `@Authorized()`. `@Authenticated()` checks only that the shared identity resolver produced an `Identity`; credential methods, scopes, relationships, denials, and authorization audit remain the global operation gate and application service's decisions. Mark nullable identity probes and anonymous authentication ceremonies with `@AllowAnonymous()` rather than leaving them undecorated.
- `src/server/api/always-public.ts` is the census of mounts that sit outside the scope gate. Each entry carries a written reason.
- `src/server/api/rate-limit.ts` is the one rate limiter, shared by all three surfaces. Budgets are keyed on the credential (`tokenId`, else `userId`, else IP), so a client cannot get three budgets by spreading load across GraphQL, REST, and MCP. Writes get a much smaller budget than reads; per-op exceptions live in `OP_BUDGETS`. A mount that needs to read the body to decide what a request costs — MCP, whose JSON-RPC handshake is protocol ceremony rather than work — registers a `RouteRateLimitPolicy` with `setRouteRateLimitPolicy` and keeps that knowledge in its own feature; the policy may redirect the charge to another op, never waive it, so nothing reaches a handler unmetered. It fails open when Redis is unreachable — a limiter that refuses everything when its store is down is a worse outage than briefly unmetered traffic.
- `src/server/api/audit.ts` records write/admin actions and every denial or authorization-source error. `AuthorizationService` emits the only final business-authorization result. Request-bound calls preserve the exact transport op ID through an isolated AsyncLocalStorage child context; direct service calls fall back to the canonical action. Both preserve the credential ledger pin. The event type deliberately has **no field an argument value could occupy**; if you need to record more, widen the interface in a diff a reviewer will see. Every call re-evaluates and audits independently; retention is 90 days, swept by `audit-retention-job`.
- Drift guards in `src/server/api/__tests__/` fail CI on divergence: `surface-parity` (zero missing eligible bindings and concrete reasons for structural absences), `parity-baseline` (historical operations, authority, eligibility, and bindings remain intact), `op-class-coverage` (runtime ops ↔ matrix, protected-action/non-PDP partition, and canonical-action completeness), and `always-public` (no unexplained outside-gate mount). Adding an operation means classifying it and implementing all eligible counterparts; see the required parity workflow above.
- `authz/model.fga` models the **durable relationship ceiling** (exact-self users plus ledger owner/collaborator/public relationships) in the OpenFGA language, with behavioral assertions in `authz/model.test.fga.yaml`. Credentials, scopes, Stripe identifiers, temporary-object keys, and request context stay outside FGA and never become contextual tuples. No OpenFGA runtime is deployed. Protected user, billing, social, ledger control-plane/data-plane, temporary-asset, assisted-ingestion, AI, and bank actions execute through the small TypeScript PDP in `src/server/api/authorization/`; protected service/workflow methods call it before domain work, with no resolver-only authority or raw user-ID bypass, and composite actions declare every capability family once in the catalog. Public profile discovery, the static tier-quota catalog, and reads of currently public ledgers are explicit exceptions. Exact-self comes from the stable user ID; API-key and Plaid bindings come from current rows; ledger permissions and visibility come from current Gitea/Fava facts; temporary ownership comes from `tmp/{userId}/...`, all without a tuple copy, decision memo, or cross-request cache. `authorizeLedger` is only a thin ledger-service PEP over this PDP. A semantic relationship change must update the model in the same PR. See `authz/README.md` and **ADR 0010** (`../../docs/adrs/ADR010-backend-v2-authz-model.md`).

### API keys

`src/features/apikeys/` issues durable `bcio_` credentials for CI, cron, CLI, and agents. GraphQL, REST, and MCP all call `ApiKeyService`, the application-service boundary whose protected methods make one centralized authorization decision before domain work. The PDP owns the existing admin credential ceiling, exact-self/key-owner relationship, and no-self-replication rule. The service then enforces the remaining domain constraints identically on all three surfaces:

- **Minting requires a paid plan.** A pricing decision confirmed in w1/m22; existing keys keep working if a subscription lapses, because breaking a running integration is a support incident rather than a nudge.
- **A key can only narrow what its minter held,** never widen it.
- **A ledger pin is a ceiling too.** A credential confined to one ledger mints keys confined to that ledger — it may restate or inherit the pin, never name a different ledger or drop it. A blank `ledgerScope` means "inherit" and is never stored as `""`; a stored pin that is not `owner/name` makes the key not live.

Only a sha256 digest is stored, plus a display prefix. The plaintext is returned by the mint response and is unrecoverable afterwards.

A key reaches GraphQL, `/api-gateway/v1`, and MCP. MCP ledger tools accept an optional `ledger: "owner/name"` target: pinned credentials default to their pin and cannot widen it; unpinned credentials must select a target. Resource URIs select their ledger under the same pin ceiling. Account tools need no ledger. Protected services still authorize every call.

## Environment and deployment

Prefer typed defaults in `src/config/config.ts`. Add an environment variable only for secrets or values that genuinely vary by deployment.

When adding one:

1. Add it to `AppConfig` and parse it once in `src/config/config.ts`.
2. Document it in `.env.example` and `README.md`.
3. Add a placeholder/pass-through to `../../deploy/docker-mac/.env.example` and `../../deploy/docker-mac/docker-compose.yml` when the local stack needs it.
4. Update the root `bex.yaml` when the hosted deployment needs it.
5. Keep real values only in ignored local files or the deployment platform's secret store.

The service defaults to port 4104 and requires PostgreSQL and Redis. The ledger and Gitea endpoints are external-service dependencies provided by the local stack or deployment environment.
